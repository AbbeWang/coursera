1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,790
As we explore business plan, there's also
the question of

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,400
figuring out what's the best way to offer
the plan?

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,906
What should it include, what level of
detail?

4
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:14,260
And so there are a variety of these

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,200
types of questions that we'll address in
today's lecture.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,030
First of all, it's important to recognize
that there's no single right format.

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,000
The formats do vary.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,530
And although business plans and investor

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,900
presentations tend to cover very similar
topics,

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,040
it really depends on the audience that you
are developing the plan for.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,740
If it's for an internal audience, then I
can share some examples for you today.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,600
And these are great examples one is from
the small

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,180
business association and one is from a
leading venture capital

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,770
firm in the U.S. And either of these
models will

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,690
work for you and your internal team within
your organization.

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,990
If you are writing a plan that's going to
be submitted for grant funding,

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,100
for loan, for lending, for investors, I
would certainly

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,070
council you to see what their preferred
format is.

19
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,260
Or you might just be changing sections
around, you

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,550
might be adding a little more detail than
others.

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,030
Or there might be specific things that you
would

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,930
include within an appendix, that they will
be looking for.

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,660
so in that way again, I would say that
many

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,420
plans covers some more content but always
check in and

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,120
make sure that you're writing the plan and
covering the

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,218
content for the audience that you're
going to be submitting it to.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,340
So while there's not a single format, I'm
going to share two of them today.

28
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,520
One is from the US small business
administration.

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,240
And so this is essentially, the table of
contents for what

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,720
they look for, when they're working with
entrepreneurs to write plans.

31
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,940
Typically starts with an executive
summary, then

32
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,880
some discussion of the company and the
product.

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,700
You'll talk about the market,

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,750
the competition, the customers, the
industry, all in part three.

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,190
Part four is largely about the team, how
you're going to organize and operate.

36
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,700
Five is sales and marketing, advertising
inclusive.

37
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,320
Six, you get into some more details about
future categories and product lines.

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,360
And then the final elements are the
funding and the financials.

39
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,850
So we'll look at each

40
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,310
of these briefly.

41
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,006
So executive summary, if you're working on
nominally a

42
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:19,690
20 page plan, executive summary might be
two pages.

43
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,300
[NOISE]

44
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,220
It also, should be a summary and not

45
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,740
an introduction, and people often get this
confused.

46
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,260
What does an introduction do?

47
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,540
When you read an introduction to a paper,
or an introduction to a book?

48
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,510
>> It leads you into the main idea.

49
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,730
>> It leads you into it.

50
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,980
It kind of gives you a little bit of a
background, gives you a little warm up.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,149
What happens when you read the
introduction?

52
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,890
Can you not read the rest of the plan or

53
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,370
not read the rest of the book and know
what happens?

54
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,750
No, you have been introduced.

55
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,490
Conversely what should a summary do?

56
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,580
What should a summary do?

57
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,780
>> well it should, tell you everything
that

58
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,920
you need to know, but state it very small.

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,700
>> Okay, it should do, and as

60
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,690
prescribed, it should summarize, it should
tell you

61
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,800
everything that's critical, but do it in a
very abbreviated way.

62
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,560
So within your executive summary, it
should have the highlights

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,860
of the whole plan, but in a page or two.

64
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,520
>> Is this all on the SBA's website?

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,560
>> it's on the SBA site, yep, and it'll
be posted on our site as well.

66
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,060
>> Okay.

67
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,130
>> so in that way, what you see here, is
that with the executive

68
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,020
summaries, it's the whole, plan
summarized.

69
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,290
Why write such a thing, if you give
somebody

70
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,120
a plan, expecting them to read the whole
plan?

71
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,040
>> You can make a good first impression.
>> Okay.

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,000
Can make a good first impression.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,110
What do investors do with executive
summaries as related to the plan?

74
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,110
>>

75
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,773
[COUGH].

76
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:02,810
>> What do you think they use the
executive summary to figure out?

77
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,040
>> Whether it's worth even meeting the
rest of

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,070
[CROSSTALK]?

79
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,680
>> Am I going to even read your plan?

80
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,000
The popular venture capital firms get 100
plans a day.

81
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,720
The really popular ones get 500 plans a
day.

82
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,100
And these are companies that might only be
ten or 20 person companies.

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,210
So venture capital firms while they manage
a lot of money, are often relatively

84
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:35,330
small, dozens of employees if that, who's
going to read 100 plans a day?

85
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,770
So in that way with the executive

86
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,860
summaries, it is essentially your
opportunity to make

87
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,560
an impression to try and persuade people
to go and read the rest of the plan.

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,900
So with that, when you begin to get into

89
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,020
the plan, so the executive summary lays on
top.

90
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,060
From there the next section is the company
description in the context of who are you?

91
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
What do you do?

92
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,690
How do you do it?

93
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,350
And when we look at what's the difference
between a

94
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,670
business plan and an investor
presentation, the content is similar.

95
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,860
So this is the content that you would use,
the

96
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,720
order that we're going through here, for
an investor presentation.

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,570
You're just typically doing it in
PowerPoint as

98
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,230
opposed to doing it in a Word document.

99
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,030
So, with company description, you begin to
introduce the

100
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,050
firm, you begin to introduce what you do,
you

101
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,700
begin to highlight the success factors,
how long have

102
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,450
you been around, what have you
accomplished to date.

103
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,910
When you get into talking about market in
the SBA's

104
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,040
format, they include a lot of things in
this section.

105
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,300
Within the market analysis, they begin to
talk about

106
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,800
the industry, talk about the life cycle
and growth rates

107
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,950
and stages so again, all of the pieces of

108
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,420
industry analysis that you would expect,
would be covered here.

109
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06,770
They talk about the competition, strengths
and weaknesses, entry barriers,

110
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,730
and they talk about the regulatory
environment,

111
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,010
and they talk about the customers in that
space;

112
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,910
demographics, psychographic, locations,
behaviors,

113
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,779
buying decisions and patterns, etc.

114
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,670
When we look at the organizations piece,
this is

115
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,620
where you begin to introduce the people of
the company.

116
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,550
Who are you?

117
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,166
What have you done?
What do you want to do?

118
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,320
Do you have advisers?

119
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,775
Do you have directors?
So, you will cover all of that as well.

120
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:45,910
Within the marketing plan, so here we've

121
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,890
gone beyond talking about the market of
the

122
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,510
customers and gone into specifically, of
how

123
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,690
are we going to market this product, or
service?

124
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,720
Where are we going to advertise?

125
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,460
How much are we going to spend on
advertising?

126
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,740
What's kind of the branding, and
positioning that we want to have?

127
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,068
How are we going to sell it?

128
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:09,610
Are we selling it directly to customers,
are we

129
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,860
doing it face to face, online through
partners, we're going

130
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,900
to wholesale to retailers, that are then
going to

131
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,510
sell, through various cost and pricings
and logic for that.

132
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,870
Talking about benefits of the product or
service.

133
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,160
Also it's rare that you have a one product
company.

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,385
Most companies may start with a product,

135
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:33,790
[SOUND]

136
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,290
but

137
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,200
can you think of a company that has a lot
of products?

138
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,550
>> Under Armour.

139
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,900
>> Under Armour has a lot of products.

140
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,720
So with Under Armour they're selling,
what?

141
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,010
What does Under Armour producer sell?
>> T-shirts.

142
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,760
>> Shirts.

143
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,100
>> Shorts.
>> Shorts.

144
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,550
>> Shoes.
>> Shoes.

145
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,710
>> Socks.
>> Socks.

146
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,390
>> sports equipment.

147
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,020
>> Sports equipment like.
>> Equipment, baseball.

148
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,770
>> Okay, so baseball equipment.
Lacross equipment.

149
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,860
>> Underwear.
>> Underwear.

150
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,080
>> Backpacks.

151
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,880
>> Backpacks.
>> Hats.

152
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,560
>> Hats.

153
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,380
>> Headbands.
>> Headbands.

154
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:19,380
>>

155
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,907
[INAUDIBLE].

156
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:24,170
>> Sweatshirts.
>> String bags.

157
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,760
>> Training bags.
>> Socks.

158
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,490
>> Okay we already had socks.
>> Water bottles.

159
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,940
>> Water bottles.

160
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:37,445
And they sell, again, cleats.
They sell, coats.

161
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:40,780
Jackets.
What did they start selling?

162
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,220
What was product number one?
A shirt much like you're wearing.

163
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,948
Want to stand up?

164
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:51,954
Yeah.
So, a

165
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:58,250
shirt.
A shirt.

166
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,670
Are you going to get investors excited
about selling a shirt?

167
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,380
No.

168
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,610
Are investors going to take you seriously
if you come in

169
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,460
and say well, we want to launch 30
different products this week.

170
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,620
>>

171
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,970
>> No.
So you kind of have to find

172
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,070
the balance of, let's focus on step one,
of what are we going to do first,

173
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,270
and it's often doing one product well, and
we might not be able to sell a black.

174
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,202
It's called hereford?

175
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:25,202
>>

176
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:25,867
[INAUDIBLE].

177
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:28,123
>> So we might not be able to sell

178
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:32,560
a black hereford basketball shirt, what
size is that?

179
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,280
>> it's a large.

180
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,450
>> In large, and that be our only
product.

181
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,380
What's the problem with that.
>> Market size.

182
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,450
>> Your market size might be 40 people.

183
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,630
So again with apparel, it's a little bit
tricky

184
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,440
and you might need different colors and
you might

185
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,130
need different sizes, but you want to
recognize, we

186
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,980
need to start relatively small to have
some success.

187
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,440
And to turn a little bit of money into
more

188
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,110
money that we can then invest into the
next thing.

189
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,652
But also recognize that when you think
about service and product

190
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:09,530
lines, you're probably not going to be
just a shirt company forever.

191
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,830
You're probably going to expand and grow
that into other areas.

192
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,250
So, that's something to think about as
well.

193
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,870
>> Under Armour makes, like, the unique
shirt that's pure nylon.

194
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,210
Hasn't really been done before.

195
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,490
How did they find a manufacturer?

196
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,390
>> Well, there are a couple of embedded
questions.

197
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,550
One, you know, what they've done, and has
it

198
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,939
been done before, and were other people
doing it?

199
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:36,160
You know, is a question but a more
fundamental question is, how do you find

200
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,960
your manufacturers?

201
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,428
And you can go online, you can go to the

202
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:45,910
Ali Babas and the Thomson registries, you
can Google and try

203
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,290
and find, you can go to, you know, other
small

204
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,089
companies, maybe outside of your region
and see who they're using.

205
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,120
You can do those things but in time, who

206
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,450
do you think Under Armour wanted to make
their stuff?

207
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,620
When they got to the point that they were
getting some momentum and they needed to

208
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,109
find the company by name that they wanted
to partner with to make their stuff.

209
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,920
Who else do you think that company made
stuff for?

210
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,440
>> Nike.

211
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,410
>> Nike.

212
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,430
So they wanted to know in time, who makes
Nike stuff?

213
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,340
And so they found that

214
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,250
person and then they went to China and met
with him.

215
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,345
Why did that make sense?
>>

216
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,334
[INAUDIBLE].

217
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:38,950
>> Go ahead.
>> Because they know what they're doing?

218
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,420
>> Because you want somebody that's a
leader.

219
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,380
You want somebody that's been there,
that's done

220
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,220
it, that knows it, that can do it.

221
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,370
Now you might also have a little bit of
reservation.

222
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,320
Well do I want my biggest competitor's,
supplier

223
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,170
to be my supplier too, and how am I

224
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,980
concerned about crossover in knowledge and
confidentiality and so

225
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,250
there was this, some elements to work out
but

226
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,100
fundamentally, when you're looking at
service and product

227
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,930
lines, the lesson here is recognized, you
might start

228
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,970
with one or two things, but it's hard to

229
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,340
build a sizable company just doing that
one thing.

230
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,470
So think about, how do we extend?
How do we grow?

231
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:22,310
What makes sense for future products that
we could launch, that are favorable.

232
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,900
So for Under Armour to go from shirts, to
pants,

233
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,937
to jackets, to hats, to shoes, to

234
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:36,719
equipment, you see there's some rationale
to it.

235
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,650
But should they have gone into making
iPhone cases?

236
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,140
>> No.

237
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,370
>> Could.
There's a brand.

238
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,860
So why don't they spend a lot of time on
figuring out how to make iPhone cases?

239
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,114
>> Because they're mainly just an
apparel company.

240
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,580
>> They are not really known for that.

241
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,565
It's arguably a different customer, it's
arguably different retailer.

242
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:11,980
I don't go to Dick's Sporting Goods and
Sports Authority looking for iPhone cases.

243
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,160
I look for sporting, apparel and
equipment.

244
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,580
So in that way,

245
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,780
we think about how we can grow and expand
and do it in a way, that makes sense, that

246
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,200
might leverage the customers that we
already have, that

247
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,010
might leverage the relationships and
partnerships that we already have.

248
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,930
Also within this, you want to clarify any

249
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,730
existing or planned intellectual property
that you have.

250
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,200
Any copyrights or trademarks on your
names, your logos,

251
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,780
any patents that you have or that have
filed for,

252
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,040
you will cover them here as well.
For the funding requests.

253
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,040
>>

254
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,940
[COUGH].

255
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,070
>> What you see regarding the trajectory
of finance for most companies, is that

256
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:01,594
they operate in a model whereby over

257
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:06,630
time, they're going to have a funding
pattern that

258
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,015
may look something like this.
So in that way, what you see,

259
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:14,260
[SOUND]

260
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,020
is that over time, my cash flow,

261
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:28,580
is going to look something like this.
This is time zero.

262
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,010
What do you think this time is?

263
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,290
>> Break even.
>> Break even.

264
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,610
What happens at break even?

265
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,740
What's break even?

266
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,500
>> You make the amount of money that you
originally invested.

267
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,610
>> Essentially.
You were close, but not quite there.

268
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,260
Its not that you make the amount that you

269
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,920
originally invested, but you make the
amount per month.

270
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,320
>> That's all of your expenses.

271
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,940
>> That you spend per month.

272
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,340
So in that way, what we essentially mean,
is that revenues equals expenses.

273
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,230
So in that way, based on money made

274
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,230
that month, we can cover expenses from
that month.

275
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,570
Everything that's here, are essentially
losses to date.

276
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:22,300
Everything that's here, is going to
typically be profits.

277
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,170
So how much money do you need?

278
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,310
How much money do you need to start your
company,

279
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,290
based on this graph?
>> More than you think.

280
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,290
>> More than you think.

281
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,950
What area of the graph illustrates how
much money you need to start your firm?

282
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,790
>> The part under.

283
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,780
>> The start under the curve.

284
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,960
So in this area, if you know how much

285
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,220
this is, that's how much money you need to
raise.

286
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,260
Make sense?
So that's what

287
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,130
the funding requests are going to be
geared towards.

288
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,700
So with a funding request, it should
specify, how much do we need?

289
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,680
Now, in our example here, it was how much
do we need to break even?

290
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,400
And for your firm, that might be the
amount you ask for initially.

291
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,020
That might be more than you're able to
effectively raise

292
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,990
initially, so you might have to raise it
in stages.

293
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,650
And again, we'll talk about financing a
little bit later and

294
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,270
what that means when you're doing kind of
phases of fundraising.

295
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,820
But fundamentally, you often need some
degree of money.

296
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,618
And maybe it's money that you have as the
founders of the management team.

297
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:38,630
Maybe it's money you need to get

298
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,390
from elsewhere, but you also want to talk
about where we're going to use it, and

299
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,600
what's the expected income and result of

300
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,700
that, and that's what the income
statements address.

301
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,600
And income statements you're looking at,
what are we going to sell?

302
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,470
At what price?

303
00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:00,920
And, what expenses do we occur?
And what's the profitability thereafter?

304
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,600
so fairly simple in logic and we'll take a
look at that as well.

305
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,210
balance sheets and cash flow statements
are more accounting

306
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:11,356
instruments, but are helpful in
reconciling where's the money?

307
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:12,210
Where are our assets?

308
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,790
Where are our liabilities?

309
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,700
And then with cash flow that's very much
like a checking account.

310
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,820
And what money's coming in and what
money's going out.

311
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,320
And other things you, you may include,
come

312
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,330
within an appendix, that are a bit more
about

313
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,420
the team, a bit more about the company,
any

314
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,860
letters of reference, any perspective
customers you've met with.

315
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,230
If you have a letter from a perspective

316
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,800
customer for a product that you've not yet
made

317
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,890
because it says they will buy it, and they
would pay x, amount if it were available.

318
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,870
What's that do for your ability to raise
money?

319
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,640
>> You know that if you make that you're

320
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,840
going to get back a certain amount of
money.

321
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,780
>> You get some degree of confidence,
that

322
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,960
if you'll make it, then they will buy it.

323
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,320
And so in that way, it removes part of the
element of investors wondering

324
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,750
if anybody wants it, of lenders wondering
if you're ever going to make any money.

325
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,790
If you can go through and if you can show,
I've spoken with people, they want it.

326
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,470
They're willing to pay for it,

327
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,700
here's who I've spoken to, here's what
they've said.

328
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,265
So you can include those types of things
within the plan as well.

329
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:30,240
[COUGH]

330
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,020
So I also want to share the suggested
format from Sequoia Capital,

331
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,670
which is a large venture capital firm in
the Silicon Valley area.

332
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,790
And when you look at Sequoia, they have
invested,

333
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,260
in many companies that you, so when you
look at Sequoia

334
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,440
and some other companies they've invested
in, we see a few here.

335
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,540
Atari.

336
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,370
You know Cypress.
You may know Cisco.

337
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,840
You may know Electronic Arts.
Drop Box.

338
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,390
Evernote.

339
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,740
Nvidia.
Oracle,

340
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,160
Pure Digital.

341
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,090
We're actually going to talk about them a
little bit later.

342
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,510
So you see, perhaps a lot of tech firms
you

343
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,595
don't know but also a lot that you do
know.

344
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:29,053
[SOUND]

345
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:32,520
>> Bless you.
>> Thank you.

346
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,940
>> A lot of the mobile ones are still
probably fairly small.

347
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,265
Let's look at the, the web ones.

348
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:43,524
[CROSSTALK]

349
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:49,054
>> So Air B and B, if

350
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:54,265
you know them.

351
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:57,021
[CROSSTALK]

352
00:19:57,021 --> 00:20:00,550
>> Google, you heard of them?
>>

353
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,227
[CROSSTALK].

354
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,340
>> Game Fly, Instagram.
>>

355
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,920
[CROSSTALK]

356
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,710
Tumblr.

357
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:14,120
>> TruLu, Tumblr, Youtube, Yahoo, so
they've done alright.

358
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:20,514
So we'll take a step back here.
So again, Sequoia

359
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:25,964
invested in the Google's, the Yahoo's, the
YouTubes,

360
00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:30,833
nVidias, Electronic Arts, Tumblr,
Instagram.

361
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:37,598
So a lot of companies you may know, and
their format is similar and

362
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:44,680
that they look for that company purpose in
a sentence, typically.

363
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,250
How do you tell somebody what you do in a
sentence?

364
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:58,766
You have a 500 words sentence

365
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:04,220
or a one pretty good sentence.

366
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,574
You talk about the problem, here's the
opportunity, here's what it is

367
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:13,170
we're solving, here's why you should care
about the rest of our plan.

368
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,110
And I like that a lot.

369
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,180
I'm of the mindset if people aren't
convinced that there's

370
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,640
a problem, if people don't see the
opportunity,

371
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,990
they don't care how you're going to solve
it.

372
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,386
Easy to write a business plan, somewhat

373
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,434
formulaic, very easy to write a business
plan.

374
00:21:30,434 --> 00:21:35,320
Harder to find a real problem, harder to
find a good opportunity.

375
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,030
And so I think addressing that and making

376
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,890
that convincing in the beginning, is
important and helpful.

377
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,700
Then there's the question of, how are we
going to solve it?

378
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,515
So instead of coming out of the gate and
saying here's our solution,

379
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,430
[SOUND]

380
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,750
convince me that there's a problem of
opportunity

381
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,410
and then tell me how you're going to solve
it.

382
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,710
And why is now a good time?

383
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,380
What else is going on in the market?

384
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,930
What else has been tried?

385
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,010
What are other people doing or trying to
do or

386
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,430
might do and how is what you're going to
do better?

387
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,354
Are there enough people that care?
If you have a problem, that's

388
00:22:12,354 --> 00:22:17,710
a problem for one person, that's okay.
But unless they're going to pay you,

389
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,000
exceedingly well and unless you're 100%
confident that they're going to say

390
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,400
yes, that's not going to be a market size
worth going after, typically.

391
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,920
So in that sense what we want to do here
is define,

392
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,960
how big's the market, what constitutes

393
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,340
them, competitors again, be careful with
competitors.

394
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,920
Sometimes, particularly with
presentations, people

395
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,820
want to put up a competitor slide

396
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,640
and show five logos and then go to the
next slide.

397
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,635
What's the problem with that?

398
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,218
[SOUND]

399
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,060
>> Is it, people may think you're
advocating for your competitor?

400
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,510
>> Okay, maybe you're advertising, but
if you're supposed to be telling me

401
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,380
about your competition, and you show me
five logos, what have you done?

402
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,380
>>

403
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,622
[INAUDIBLE]

404
00:23:06,622 --> 00:23:09,980
competition.
>> You haven't told me anything.

405
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,940
You haven't told me anything about what do
they do.

406
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,790
How do they do it?
How are you different or better?

407
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,310
So in that way again, talking about the
competitors and

408
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,350
doing some analysis, ideally beyond just
what's on their website.

409
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,400
Again, everybody knows what's on their
website.

410
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,319
You'll want to do some research and do
some investigation beyond that.

411
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,920
And then you begin

412
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,000
talking about your product and you not
only

413
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,740
are describing it in words, but you're
showing pictures.

414
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,810
And even with a written plan, or a
presentation

415
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,830
showing a sketch, showing a rendering,
showing a picture.

416
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,530
If you have the opportunity to show
something tangible or bring something

417
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,760
to a presentation, that's a lot more
significant, that's a lot more meaningful.

418
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,310
It helps people visualize what the
opportunity is, and it also

419
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,380
helps people remember what it is that they
saw.

420
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,350
Business model of how do the pieces

421
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,460
fit, what's the values, what's the
customer segment?

422
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,330
What are the partnerships and alliances?

423
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,150
So how does it work?
What's your price?

424
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,720
Team and the financials.

425
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,050
So you'll see between the two formats, the
SBA element is very detailed,

426
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,800
and a lot of that is often times geared
towards getting a loan from a bank.

427
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,620
The Sequoia Capital one is a bit more
accelerated.

428
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,350
I would argue, a bit more purposeful.

429
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,100
And in that way, for me, I tend to favor
the Sequoia one a bit.

430
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,688
But I like the SBA one and that it gives
you a little bit of

431
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:53,758
a, deeper lever of insight a deeper level
of detail of the types of things that

432
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:57,470
you want to be mindful of, and that you
want to address.

433
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,020
In summary, when you think about authoring
the plan, certainly make

434
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,840
sure that you consider the preferred
format for your target audience.

435
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,090
Also, be sure to be clear, specific, and
convincing.

436
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,730
So in that way, beware of these common
mistakes.

437
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,360
Don't make it overly long.
don't make it confusing.

438
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,380
don't try to be overly clever.

439
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,590
but again, focus that you understand the
market, you understand

440
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,610
your customer, that you've got the right
team, and that

441
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,240
you have a clear path for how the business
is

442
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,230
going to grow and how the business is
going to have success.
