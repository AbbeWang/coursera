1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,700
Today we're going to introduce the
business plan.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,230
And it all starts with defining the
business plan.

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,970
Key elements that we're going to talk
about is.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,950
What is the plan?

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,010
Why write a plan?

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,210
As well as what are some of the

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,680
advantages and disadvantages of authoring
great business plans?

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,270
Its essentially your play book for running
the company.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,065
So in that way we're looking at it's a
plan for the creation of the

10
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:31,894
company, what's it going to take to get a
launched

11
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:35,300
as well as what's it going to take to
manage it.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,730
And with most plans you're going to be
looking somewhat in a

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,250
infinite timeline, what do you think the
business is going to be doing.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:48,660
Three years from now, five year, five
years from now and in perpetuity.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,890
Now the bulk of your attention and the
bulk of your

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,080
pages, and the bulk of your focus is on
what are we

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,070
going to do now and what are we going to
do in the next few years?

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,770
But it's talking about the marketing,

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,150
inclusive of the product design and
development.

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,270
It's talking about the operations.

21
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,070
It's talking about the financing, it's

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,340
talking about the teams and the
partnerships.

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,860
And you're doing it all in typically less
than 20 pages.

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,160
So in that way, you could spend hundreds

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,400
and arguably thousands of pages on these
topics.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,540
because it's a big deal to write what is
my company going to do.

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,196
In every detail forever.

28
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:28,980
Why is it constrained?
Why is it

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,060
often less than twenty pages?

30
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,030
Yep?

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,680
>> Potential investors can read through
it quickly.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,290
>> There's the element of well who's the
audience?

33
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,970
And we'll talk about audience.

34
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,490
And the you is the team that's the
audience, or

35
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,800
partners, or investors, or lenders that
may be the audience.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,680
Their attention span is relatively brief.

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,100
And even 20 is a bit on the long side.

38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,870
But in that way if they're going to put
thousands, or

39
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,870
hundreds of thousands, or millions of
dollars into a venture

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,690
they want to see the details.
And so that's, again.

41
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,260
While we work with something that I will
call,

42
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,850
kind of a medium weight at this 20 page
element.

43
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,310
As far as, what is it?

44
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,840
So, in that context, it's defining exactly
how

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,230
the company's going to materialize,
exactly the market size.

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,710
Exactly the competitors.

47
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,980
Why the team have constituted.
And as it plans

48
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,610
to evolve.

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,880
Among the founders, the management, and
the advisers and

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,410
investors is the right team that can carry
this off.

51
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,400
And its also an owner's manual for the
company.

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,460
Even if you don't plan to raise money from

53
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,060
investors, even if you don't plan to seek
a bank

54
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,940
loan, I would argue that a business plan
is

55
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,170
certainly worth doing because it gives you
as the owner.

56
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,370
Some insights and I put some ideas to
paper, and it lets you connect

57
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,600
the dots of how does the project connect
to

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
the market, connect to the competition,
connect to the financials.

59
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,130
And you can use it as a goal-setting
instrument as well that we'll talk about.

60
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,590
So in that way again, forces you to write

61
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,630
things down, particularly if you're
working as a team.

62
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,560
It helps you to set some goals, it helps
you

63
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,590
to define where do we want to be in a
year.

64
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,220
Where do we want to be in three years,
particularly on the financials,

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,730
also helps focus you on what you should do
and what you shouldn't do.

66
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,370
When is it valuable to know what types of
products and services you should do?

67
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,520
Or what types of marketing or customers
you should go after,

68
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,110
after you write the plan initially.

69
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,980
When is it valuable to check in on those
things?

70
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,610
Yep?
>> before you make a new product.

71
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,000
>> Okay.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,050
Before you make a new product, so you may
be very clear in the beginning.

73
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,790
This is what we want to do, this is our
product, this is our audience.

74
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,350
This is how it's competitive.

75
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,000
But in six months, in a year.
What changes?

76
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,780
What changes for your venture a year after
you've started?

77
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,650
Does anything change?
>> The market might change.

78
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,120
Customer's opinions might change.

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,220
>> The short answer is, everything may
change.

80
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,200
The market may change, competitors may
change.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,370
Customer needs and wants change.

82
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,970
People know what a netbook is?
Heard of a netbook?

83
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,140
>> Yeah.
>> What's a netbook?

84
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,620
>> A little laptop.
>> A netbook is a laptop?

85
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,240
>> No, a small laptop.
>> A small laptop.

86
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,270
What can you do on a netbook?

87
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,690
Different than a laptop.
>> Bring it around easier.

88
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,030
>> Okay, its highly portable.

89
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,470
Smaller than a laptop, lighter.

90
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,520
What else do you think a netbook was
designed for?

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,730
>> Wasn't it designed mainly to use the
internet?

92
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,970
>> The internet.

93
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,760
So again, the name kind of alludes to a
netbook for an internet.

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,850
And so, a couple of years ago, people
thought

95
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,630
that everybody was going to replace
laptops with netbooks.

96
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,130
All you needed to do was get to internet,
and you would no longer need a laptop.

97
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,130
You don't need software on your computer.

98
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,940
You don't need files on your computer.
You just need internet access.

99
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,470
And everything is going to be at your
disposal.

100
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,740
And you can buy that net book for half, or
a third,

101
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,000
or a quarter of the price of what a laptop
would be.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
But they

103
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,430
never really took off.

104
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,829
kind of died out, why do you think the
netbook market never really took off?

105
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,780
>> Part of it could have been the
popularity of tablets.

106
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,576
>> Okay.

107
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:44,930
>> So tablets came along and I no longer
really needed a keyboard.

108
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,190
Portable was good, but I'd rather have
more portable.

109
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,459
And kind of the form and the feature and
the function of it.

110
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,070
Was somewhat inferior to tablets pending
your purpose and use of the tablet.

111
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,040
What else do people do?

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,590
Anybody not store any files locally?

113
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,390
You just put everything up on Google, you

114
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,320
put everything on these cloud drives, on
Amazon.

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,770
You don't keep any files locally at all,
none.

116
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,375
One?
Yes, two, why?

117
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,650
>> My computer shut down so I can't see
this stuff anymore, so I have to do that.

118
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:27,480
>> Okay so you have some computer
issues, some software issues, or hardware

119
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,750
issues so you can't save files, so you
have to store them online.

120
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,800
So is that your plan?
You're going to do this forever?

121
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,270
>> No, I'm going to get a new one.

122
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,730
>> Okay, so it's kind of a temporary
fix.

123
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,120
You do it?
>> Yeah.

124
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,440
>> Why?

125
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,400
>> Because the computer I use has no
files.

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,500
>> Okay, so it gives you a little more
flexibility.

127
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,026
If I don't need my computer with me.

128
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:53,750
If I'm at work, if I'm at school, if I'm
at library, if I'm with friends, etc.

129
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,630
All I need is Web, and I can get to the
files I want.

130
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,640
What's the problem with that?

131
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,830
What's the downside with that when you go
into a scenario where everything

132
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,760
is online?

133
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,449
What's the problem?

134
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,220
Why only one person doing it
intentionally,

135
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,980
one person does it as an IT workaround.

136
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,050
Why do the other 33 of you store files
locally?

137
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,650
>> It's less convenient.

138
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,290
>> Which is less convenient?
>> Storing them online.

139
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,030
>> Okay, online feels less convenient.
Why?

140
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,030
>> because you have to go on to the
Internet.

141
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,960
>> Because you have to get online we may
not have web access everywhere we go.

142
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,600
So we have to get online, and even if we
do

143
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,342
have web access we have to kind of take
the time.

144
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:44,842
Yep?

145
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,210
>> It's because I always know if a
websites crashing, or sometimes.

146
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,380
>> Okay.

147
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,090
Sometimes you can't get online.

148
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,880
Sometimes you don't have an internet
connection.

149
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,505
Sometimes sites are unavailable.
Or crash

150
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:59,940
[NOISE]

151
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,860
why else?

152
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:09,040
Why not keep your files elsewhere and
remove them from your local PC?

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,420
What may happen.
Yep?

154
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,498
>> Well, you, you could be hacked
potentially

155
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,404
[CROSSTALK].

156
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:18,610
>> Okay.

157
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,960
It's a, people have security issues of
would they potentially be hacked.

158
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,630
Can somebody get on that server and see
those files that are often some

159
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,810
cloud whereas do I have more confidence
that if at least they're on my.

160
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,830
Local if they're on my hard drive, if
they're on

161
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,510
my local device, do I have more confidence
that they're secure?

162
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,070
So again there were a number of reasons
that it never

163
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,920
really took off and it changed and you saw
companies recognize that.

164
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,700
The smart companies

165
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,880
recognized that.

166
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,590
And get out of the netbook market pretty
quickly, and go back into an ultrabook

167
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:55,940
market which kind sat in between in the
context of still light, still very

168
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,740
portable, but still retained all those
kind of laptop advantages in large part.

169
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,550
What we also saw was a technology that

170
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,890
emerged, hard-drives are increasingly rare
in your laptop.

171
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,240
Why is that the case?

172
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,590
Why have a hard-drive meaning that a disc
that's going

173
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,740
to spin around like a record player to
read data?

174
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,810
Why are they scarce?

175
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,900
>> They easily overheat.

176
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,390
>> There's a heating issue.

177
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,650
>> Solid state drives have replaced
them.

178
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,630
>> What's a solid state drive?
>> Has no moving parts.

179
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,560
>> Okay.

180
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,450
So what we're finding is that the small
these types of things, these solid state

181
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,060
drives that people have had on key rings
and whatnot for a little while now.

182
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,190
That has no moving parts.

183
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,550
It's just kind of data,

184
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,620
you're just getting elements like this
that are big, that are in your laptop.

185
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,480
What's that do for your battery?

186
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,500
You don't have to power anything that
moves?

187
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,500
>>

188
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,742
[INAUDIBLE]

189
00:09:58,742 --> 00:09:59,432
[COUGH]

190
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,870
lasts a lot longer.
>> Your battery lasts a lot longer.

191
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,630
What's that do for your durability?

192
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,890
I can drop this thing and I have no
concern.

193
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,910
That my data broke.

194
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,886
That my drive is not available.
Why?

195
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:19,950
>> because, like the, the hard drive
where it's spinning

196
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,310
like, since there's small parts, fragile,
and it can break and.

197
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,490
>> Small parts.
So if you have

198
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,840
your lap.
Who has a laptop?

199
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,620
Okay.
A hard drive?

200
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,610
You have a hard drive?

201
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,850
Yeah, so you'll hold it up and drop it and
you'll be okay?

202
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,150
No, now our friend with the solid drive
might not want to

203
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,960
do it, his screen might

204
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,380
break, but different technology, different
durability.

205
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,100
And you don't have the other typical
failures that you

206
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,520
would have when you're working with a
device just from

207
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,880
wear and tear.

208
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,940
So again, different markets, things
change.

209
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,600
Technologies emerge, operations emerge,
and what you see in this

210
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,250
context is that business plans would need
to change as well.

211
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,220
What we see too is that when you have a
plan

212
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,190
it gives you some insight and some ability
to adapt in time.

213
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,190
And in that way as the markets change as
things evolve.

214
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,560
It gives

215
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,080
you a plan for what are we going to do
about that?

216
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,860
It also is very helpful as a communication
tool.

217
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,940
So in that context, it lets you know.
As we're talking with our founders, as

218
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,800
we're talking with prospective investors,
as we're talking with other partners.

219
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,270
What is it we want to say?
How do we want to say it?

220
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,380
How do we all get on the same

221
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,440
page to tell people collectively what
we're going to do,

222
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,270
how we're going to do it, where we're
going to do it,

223
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,960
when we're going to do it, what number is
tied to that?

224
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,260
And so the business plan is where all of
that is sourced from.

225
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:54,420
Often, business plans required of banks,
required of investors,

226
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,740
why does that make sense?

227
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,250
Why do they want to see your plan?
Yep?

228
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,700
>> They want to know if their investment

229
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,460
work out.
>> They want to know the future.

230
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
They want to know what are you going to do
with my money.

231
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,540
And so in that way this is your,
essentially contract of what

232
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,780
you think is going to happen based on the
monies that they're putting in.

233
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,590
And so the plan also will define what is
it we're going to do.

234
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,420
Now when you look at a company they do
lots of things.

235
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,615
Working from the top there's some
organization some

236
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,810
firms, some employees, some or charts,
some structure.

237
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,350
And then you move down and the technology,
they design things oftentimes.

238
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,510
They may procure or buy things, and then
when you go to

239
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,960
the bottom left, and begin to work across,
we may build things we

240
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,270
may manufacture things we may sell and
service things.

241
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,999
And we reap some level of profit in the
end.

242
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,940
Do you know of a company that does all of
this?

243
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,090
Let's go down the route, so Under Armor
shirt, what's Under Armor do?

244
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,270
Based on what's on this chart.

245
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,700
Taking it from the top.

246
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,240
Do they have a firm infrastructure, is
there a company?

247
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,915
>> Yes.

248
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:25,180
>> There's a company, there's HR, do
they do technology development?

249
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,370
>> Yes.

250
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,560
>> They do.

251
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,740
So they do a lot of these top-line
elements.

252
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,330
What about in the lower left?

253
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,384
These logistics operations.
Do they make

254
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:40,298
anything?
They make nothing.

255
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:46,420
Nike makes nothing.
Adidas, Reebok make nothing.

256
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,670
Why is that a true statement?

257
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,712
>> It is outsourced.
>> It is outsourced.

258
00:13:55,712 --> 00:14:00,720
What if Nike need to own a golf club
manufacturing facility?

259
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,780
Why would you want to own a golf club
manufacturing facility?

260
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,440
When do people buy golf clubs?

261
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,430
Or track shoes,

262
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,688
or Tennis shoes, made for Tennis.
Yep.

263
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:27,950
>> When do we need such things?

264
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,190
>> When they're in season?
>> When they're in season.

265
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,860
A lot of people by these type of things in
the Spring.

266
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,980
If you're going to buy snowboard related
things,

267
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,840
you're going to buy it late Fall, early
Winter.

268
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,930
If you're going to buy swim gear you're
going to buy it typically late Spring.

269
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,120
Now it varies a little bit regionally.

270
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,730
Weather patterns, parts of the world, etc.

271
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,230
But for most of these firms they don't
want to own factories.

272
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,330
When they're only using a piece of that
production.

273
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,540
You also hear elements of low cost of
manufacturing.

274
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,460
What happens when I buy a plant and a
location,

275
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,180
and I think that there's a low cost of

276
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,840
manufacturing, a low cost of labor
associated with that?

277
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,780
What happens as communities and markets
and cities grow?

278
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,710
What happens to the cost of labor?
>> It goes up.

279
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,900
>> It goes up.

280
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:30,100
So as cities emerge and grow and get more
populous, cost of living goes up.

281
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,370
Cost of labor goes up.

282
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,509
What does that mean if you own that
factory?

283
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:37,660
Yep?

284
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,960
>> It costs more money, to pay the
workers more.

285
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,790
>> Okay, so in that way all of your
costs went up.

286
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,520
What does it mean if you have outsourced
to that factory?

287
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,140
What do you do?

288
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,330
What do many companies do?

289
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,880
Yep.

290
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,800
>> I mean, it depends on if they have a
long term contract.

291
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,930
>> And if they don't?

292
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,170
>> If they don't, they might leave or
negotiate.

293
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,960
>> You move somewhere else.

294
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,030
You find new providers.

295
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,860
So you see a whole pattern of this
emerging.

296
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,820
And fundamentally, Nike is not the best at
manufacturing.

297
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,270
Under Armor is not the best at
manufacturing.

298
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,200
They want to go to the people that know
how to manufacture well.

299
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,690
And they can move around.

300
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,780
Based on who gets better, and who gets
stronger, and who gets more competitive.

301
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,300
Most companies do these elements that are
shaded.

302
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,130
Most companies, there's some element of
company, there's some

303
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,780
element of design, development.

304
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,490
But most firms are not involved in
manufacturing.

305
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,120
Not all firms are even involved in
marketing and selling.

306
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,540
Now, a couple are.

307
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,830
There are a few Nike stores.
There are a few Under Armour stores.

308
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,140
But I would expect that 95 to, probably
99% of what

309
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,130
they sell, is not out of the few stores
that they own.

310
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,610
They're selling into all of the other
retailers.

311
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,060
The big box retailers.

312
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,620
So in that way, even marketing sales they
do, but it may not

313
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,730
be to the in consumer, it might be to some
intermediary as well.

314
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,120
The reason that this chart is helpful is
that you want to think about these.

315
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,420
You want to think about these elements and

316
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,830
value chain, as you're looking at your
companies.

317
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,430
And recognizing what are we going to do
versus what may still need

318
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,360
to be done but we're going to do it
through other partnerships or

319
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,390
agreements or outsourcing.
So, great plans

320
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,070
take some time.
And I've worked with entrepreneurs on

321
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,430
plans where they were on version 17 before
they showed it to the first investor.

322
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,312
And took about eight months to write that
plan.

323
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:48,460
Typically not the thing you write in a
weekend, typically not

324
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,440
the thing you write in a month.
May take some time.

325
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,960
And particularly, with awareness of
business model canvas.

326
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,540
Doing business model canvas, kind of
validating

327
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,610
your plan, getting that customer feedback,

328
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,990
are things you would want to do before you
write the full business plan.

329
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,650
So in that way disadvantages are takes
time, needs to be updated.

330
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,550
Not something you write once, put on a
shelf, and never look at again.

331
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:31,410
Also something you want to invite some
critical review of.

332
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,620
In that way, who do you want to review
your plan?

333
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,500
Often times, I have students that want to
see an example of a good plan.

334
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,910
Good plans are hard to see.
Why is that the case?

335
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,630
Why don't I have a whole catalog of

336
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,810
great, successful business plans for you
to look at?

337
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,420
Or if you write great plans?

338
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,700
Are you fine with posting those up on the
internet?

339
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,690
No, hopefully not, why not?

340
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,670
>> because then everybody's going to
know all of your plans essentially.

341
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,020
>> Everybody knows your deepest darkest
secrets.

342
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,345
Everybody knows your plan everybody knows
how you're going to attack, and

343
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:19,840
have success in a given market and we
don't want to share that.

344
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,670
Rightfully so,

345
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,670
so in that way again we don't want

346
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:30,020
to typically distribute our plan on an
open basis.

347
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,060
So who do we share it with to get the
speed back that we want?

348
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,300
Who do you show your plan to?

349
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,060
People that you know, hopefully.

350
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,670
So some people that are, have some level
of

351
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,620
insights or expertise, that you may know,
might be a

352
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,530
friend, might be a family member, might be
a

353
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,200
former colleague, might be faculty, might
be other people that

354
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,710
you have met or know in some capacity.

355
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,740
Or other people that you meet that have
some trusted reference or affiliation.

356
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:12,720
But its again, that's a very discerning on
how you do that, and when you do that.

357
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,120
In summary, when you consider the business
plan, many of us think that

358
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,670
its a document again, its only used for
investors or to get loans.

359
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,610
But as a reminder, this is your owner's
manual.

360
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,010
The business plan, in my opinion, is best
used and best leveraged by

361
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:31,140
the owners of the company and it's really
your playbook for running the company.

362
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,615
It's a tool plan, track and also adapt the
company it's also a tool for raising

363
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:38,300
capital but more fundamentally I think if
it's

364
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,780
something that you put sufficient time and
resources into.

365
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,150
And revised periodically, it's something
that can be

366
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,770
used by your senior team within your
organization to

367
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,460
make sure you're doing the right thing at
the right time.

368
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,480
And that you really stay on track to what
your goals are.

369
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,410
And if those goals change, if your
techniques, or tactics,

370
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:01,370
or strategies are modified, you update the
plan from there.

371
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,590
And so that way again it's a living
document.

372
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,240
That's good not only for investors, but
great for your team.

373
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,590
Alone.
