1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,660
In any discussion of partnerships, it's

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,430
also very valuable to understand
outsourcing.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,810
As a unique and very viable opportunity
and category or type of partnership.

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,190
When we look at outsourcing, it can happen
in a variety of ways.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,440
There are vertical opportunities to engage
with.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,410
There are transferring existing or entire
pieces or business functions to a partner.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,600
There are various types of outsourcing.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,980
It might be contract-based.
It might be business process, or IT.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,710
It might be innovation outsourcing, and
that you are

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,320
engaging others to assist in your product
development or design.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,210
So in that way, when we

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,440
think about outsourcing, historically it's
been thought

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,310
more of manufacturing Or perhaps call
centers

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,750
are very, specific in very narrow areas.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,060
But today, there's a global environment
and global

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,870
platforms that we'll talk about that are
particularly viable

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,420
for new ventures to be able to find
partners and outsource relationships,

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,270
in and beyond your country boundaries.
Why do we do it?

19
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,090
One, there might be expertise.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,340
And a lot of firms do this with law, with
accounting.

21
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:21,803
Why don't we have an attorney or an
accountant full time in every start-up?

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,430
>> because you don't really need an
attorney 24.

23
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,407
>> You don't have the need for

24
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:31,310
a full-time attorney, or a full-time
accountant.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,500
What else don't you have?

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,152
>> No money to pay them.
>> You don't have the money.

27
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:38,262
[SOUND]

28
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:41,270
You don't have the money to pay someone
full time.

29
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,060
And even if you did, if you don't have the

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,220
need, that money's probably better spent
elsewhere, paying for other things.

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,700
So again, we outsource quite a bit, even
if we're

32
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,900
just outsourcing it to someone that's down
the street from us.

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,800
It's a different skill set, it's a
different expertise.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,960
We outsource manufacturing largely because
of economies of scale We

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,760
may not have the money to buy a big
machine.

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,680
And even if we did, we probably don't have

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,640
the demand to run that machine all the
time.

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,820
So let's find people that own and operate
the machines

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,010
and buy the amount of time on that that we
need.

40
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,920
And it may only be an hour or two a day.

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
So yet you're finding people that have

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,830
the expertee, expertise, the resources,
the know how.

43
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,950
That we don't.

44
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,400
How you find them, comes in many flavors.

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,643
Elance, that's one of the popular, online
outsourcing

46
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:39,773
matchmaking firms.
And they report to have had 900.

47
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:45,263
I'm sorry.
$815 million of transactions on their

48
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:50,597
site, across 91,000 jobs, 91,000

49
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:55,423
projects of individuals and small
companies

50
00:02:55,423 --> 00:03:01,710
finding one another.
They claim 176,000

51
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,500
programmers.
192,000 writers.

52
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,870
If I need content written for my site.

53
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,190
If I need content written for marketing
materials and brochures.

54
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,750
If I need mobile 20,000 developers and

55
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,310
so in this model

56
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,110
[COUGH].

57
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,180
What you see here.

58
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:32,520
Is that the 91,000 jobs is actually posted
in the last thirty days.

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,690
So it gives you a sense of magnitude And
that there is a lot of matchmaking.

60
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,420
And they feature different people in the
promos.

61
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,970
So we have an Argentinian that's doing
mobile app development.

62
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,000
Why do I find somebody in Argentina, to do
my mobile app development?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,220
When there may be someone right here in
Maryland that can do that.

64
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,570
>> Might be cheaper.

65
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,300
>> Might be a price advantage, there
might be a skill advantage.

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,990
I'm looking for something specific or
unique.

67
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,080
There might be a time advantage, of I want

68
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,680
it, this week, this month, then maybe my
local person.

69
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,360
Can't do that.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,010
Maybe I'm trying to target that market.

71
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,380
Maybe I need something that's Spanish
language.

72
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,200
Maybe I need other things that that person
in that

73
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,900
region is going to know better than
somebody that may be local.

74
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,570
Maybe I'm a US firm developing a mobile
app for deployment in Argentina.

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,885
So, again, there are lots of different
motives and lots of different reasons.

76
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,790
[SOUND]

77
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,975
Cost is the one that's common.

78
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:46,630
[SOUND]

79
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,305
But there may be other advantages as well.

80
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:50,100
[INAUDIBLE]

81
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,550
So the fee model, is that when you go in
and when

82
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,650
you look at one of these profiles, then
again if we were

83
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,670
to click on this, and do our search, and
pull someone up,

84
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,910
we would see skill sets, and price points,
and things of that nature.

85
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,270
And what the Elance business models is, is
there's a transaction

86
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,780
fee for projects that are served and
matched on their site.

87
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,210
So they essentially

88
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,100
earn a commission for matchmaking.

89
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,295
>> Why would it be just, like, I mean
you contact the guy outside of the site

90
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:23,049
[INAUDIBLE].

91
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:28,000
>> Typically a lot of these elements are
not posting

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,310
contact information, so any time you're
doing a business model

93
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,200
where you're matchmaking online and you're
trying to generate revenues

94
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,000
off of that matchmaking, typically you
hold contact information hostage.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,840
Until the payment to you has been
transacted.

96
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,540
>> All right.

97
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,860
>> And with this model, there are
competitors.

98
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,510
ODesk, is the other big one in this space,
and what they're doing is similarly

99
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,839
doing matchmaking.
They report $257 million of earnings.

100
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,466
Based on matches that they've made, that
the average job size is the 4,300.

101
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:13,410
And right now, they have 1,400 people
working on projects.

102
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,230
And when you see the cities that are
represented and the regions that are

103
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:28,120
represented It's not all, just in China.
It's not all, just in India.

104
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,036
There's a lot of activity, a lot of
contractors, a

105
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:37,230
lot of people doing work, in the U.S, for
U.S firms.

106
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,210
And people, again probably vice versa.

107
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,740
People here that are contracting work over
here.

108
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,940
People here that are contracting work over
there.

109
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,540
So in that way, again, it happens in

110
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,210
this kind of global marketplace these days
with outsourcing.

111
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,880
And what you see in the level of
definition that you can

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,120
draw down into, is you want, perhaps,
somebody that knows software development.

113
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,930
That knows mobile apps specifically.

114
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,690
That has a feedback score of at least 4.5
on a 5.0 scale.

115
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,750
And you get people that are returned, that
fill those elements.

116
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,840
And at present, when I did that, there
were 47 people,

117
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,930
that fit that profile.

118
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,490
And then I can look at those 47 if I
choose, and see.

119
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,430
What they know by way of skills and
programs, what they charge,

120
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,630
what they have done by way of portfolio,
as in

121
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,380
can I go online and look at past work
they've performed.

122
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,539
So why do I have a $35 person, an $80
person, and

123
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:58,461
a $50 person?
Which one do I go with?

124
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:01,701
>> Probably the one with the most
experience which is the $80 person.

125
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:11,062
>> I might go with the person that has a
lot of reviews.

126
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:13,598
Yep.
>> That with the most hours.

127
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:15,495
>> I might like hours.

128
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,381
It seems like maybe they've done fewer
projects.

129
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,899
But maybe bigger projects.

130
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,691
So maybe you acquaint that with
experience?

131
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:28,098
What if I need somebody that knows
OmniGraffle?

132
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:30,585
I'm not even sure what OmniGraffle is.

133
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:31,310
How many of those are there.

134
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,350
>> One.
>> There's one.

135
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,440
So there might be a very specific skill
set or need that I have,

136
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,830
that I pay for.
Or I may do what?

137
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:50,215
What do we do sometimes when we are
resource-constrained?

138
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:50,215
>>

139
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:52,470
[UNKNOWN]

140
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,220
>> We go cheap.

141
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:00,150
So in that way, again, you have lots of
options.

142
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,210
You have lot's of options in this space to
find people you hope are a good match

143
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,470
and it's not uncommon, that you may find a
small piece of your project.

144
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,120
Rather than the whole thing that you're
trying to

145
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,100
outsource, give somebody a piece and see
how they do.

146
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,580
And do they do that well, and if so, if
their responsive, if their, if it's

147
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,120
timely, if it's quality, then you may go
back to them to do the bigger project.

148
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,579
It's not uncommon that you may hire two or
three people to do the same project.

149
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,890
A small project,

150
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,710
or three similar projects.

151
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,515
Why might you break things up into

152
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:47,520
bite-sized pieces and give it to different
people?

153
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,260
>> Because they needs maybe the pieces
need certain expertises that Okay.

154
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,800
They might be different skill sets, so
it's more than one person can do.

155
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,990
>> So you can see which one is best for
the big job.

156
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,470
>> It also lets you compare.

157
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,258
It lets me, let me run three people at the

158
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:06,456
same time, and see who runs the best, and
then

159
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:10,004
I can pick that one to do the part to the
bigger job.

160
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:12,919
So there's a little bit of kind of an art
and science in how you do

161
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,504
it, but it's important to recognize with
outsourcing

162
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:17,668
that it comes in lots of different
flavors.

163
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:20,632
That there's a global market for it, and
with

164
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:23,976
the Elances and Odesk, and things like
that that are

165
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:28,308
out there, they're increasingly easier to
find, and affordable

166
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:31,576
to find, and these, as I searched them, I
think,

167
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:33,749
in one of the earlier filters.

168
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,840
I may have clicked U.S, I'm seeing if
there's a, a geography notation here.

169
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,280
You can pick regions that you want to
focus in.

170
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,160
Yeah, so all of these are in the U.S. If I
expanded

171
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,350
that into other international areas, a lot
of the rates would drop.

172
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,630
So if for some reason you want to work
with somebody locally, you want the

173
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,340
time advantage.
You want to be able to get on the phone.

174
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,340
You can do that to.
So again, lots of options.

175
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,790
That you have.

176
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,040
So again, many models.

177
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,469
There's the off shoring of let me find
somebody outside of my home country

178
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,790
There is the, kind of the cap development
of let me set up operations elsewhere.

179
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:27,100
And there are a number of small start up
firms that I'm familiar with that

180
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,160
they have a small office in Maryland, and
then they have a second office in India.

181
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,760
So they're still a small firm.

182
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,210
They may have 50 people here and 50 people
there.

183
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,435
So they have enough work that they want to
hire and build an operation abroad.

184
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:43,815
[NOISE]

185
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:46,855
And they've elected to do that in the
different

186
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:47,539
[UNKNOWN],

187
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:50,883
particularly if it's software, or
something that

188
00:11:50,883 --> 00:11:53,999
can scale and grow, beyond their, local
market

189
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:54,540
[NOISE].

190
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,350
And then there are a variety of other
models of

191
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,860
where you can set up and partner with
people locally.

192
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,820
And when JetBlue got started,

193
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,920
they located their call, their call
center, meaning that

194
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,967
if you were to call JetBlue, you want to
talk about.

195
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Travel you're trying to make, you have
some issue with what

196
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,450
you were billed, you have some customer
service request or complaint.

197
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,730
They set up their call center in Salt Lake
City, Utah.

198
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,530
Why do we set up a call center in Utah?

199
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,780
And we're not only going to set it up in
Utah, but we're going to forward the call

200
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,200
to people's individual homes.
So we're going to have predominantly

201
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,240
women.
Working part time, at home, in Utah, is

202
00:12:51,240 --> 00:13:00,685
our call center for Jet Blue Airlines.
Why would you do such a thing?

203
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:02,684
>> Utah?
>> Utah.

204
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:02,684
>>

205
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:03,116
[INAUDIBLE]

206
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,973
reason?
>> It is a religious reason.

207
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:06,044
>> That's so messed up.

208
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:07,077
[CROSSTALK]

209
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:12,977
>> So, in that way, the founder of Jet
Blue, is a Mormon, and

210
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:19,113
he believed that, he wanted to create a
call center in the US,

211
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:25,140
and not international, what was the
perception for that?

212
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,330
[INAUDIBLE]

213
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,550
Not racist.

214
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,880
So in that way, why did he want to set up
a call

215
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,480
center in the U.S. and not abroad, as did
many of his competitors?

216
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,210
>> Because America.

217
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,470
What do you think?
>>

218
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,970
[INAUDIBLE]

219
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,030
wants to give it to them.

220
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,700
>> So he wants to keep jobs in the U.S,
he wants to

221
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,420
create economic development in the U.S.

222
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,050
He perceived there'll be a language
advantage.

223
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,110
He wanted the call center to be served by
people that

224
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,680
had English as their first language, and
thought that equaled better service.

225
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,770
He thought too that, I can have a cost
advantage, and that if

226
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,480
I can make the job easy, if you can work
from home, if

227
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,300
you can set your own hours, and if I can
hire you in

228
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,070
a part time capacity, I don't bear the
cost of full time people.

229
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,350
When do people call their lines?
When do you think most people are calling?

230
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,530
>> They might be bored.
>> They're calling at night.

231
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,350
They're calling weekend.

232
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,160
Business travelers may call during the
day, but

233
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,900
a lot of people are calling off hours.

234
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,090
So in that way too, would he perceive that
for the population

235
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,910
that he was employing There was an
interest in working part time,

236
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,840
that there was an interest in working from
home.

237
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,220
And in that way it was a model that made
sense.

238
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,520
Now as they have grown, as they've
expanded,

239
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,310
they've gone beyond what that market can
serve.

240
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,886
But it was an element of creative home
showing if you will, if you thought that.

241
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:09,340
Based on, the model, based on the needs.
Now, you cannot require, legally.

242
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,910
You cannot require that

243
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,740
someone be of a certain religion, to be
employable by your company.

244
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,070
But you can certainly locate, and market.

245
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,245
If you're trying to target a certain
Employee that has certain interests.

246
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:28,100
[COUGH].

247
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,000
But he had a pretty creative solution to

248
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,550
find employees that paralleled the needs
that he had.

249
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,670
We see people specialize.

250
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,870
So when you go to the Elance and you go to
the oDesk, a lot of

251
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,860
it's technology but it's a lot of writing

252
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,940
and creative and it's a whole assortment
of things.

253
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,630
There are some sites that started, and
many

254
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,000
that have still maintaining, doing but one
thing.

255
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:04,100
And there were a number of logo design
sites that launched Not

256
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,820
too long ago.

257
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,330
And they would offer a fixed fee model,

258
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,855
this model 295, to develop a logo.
It's that expensive.

259
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:25,405
$295 for a logo.
How do you know if it's expensive?

260
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:27,784
[CROSSTALK]

261
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:31,020
>> It's based on competition.

262
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,350
It's based on well, what are my other
options for a logo?

263
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,430
If I hire a designer.
If I go to a marketing agency.

264
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:46,833
If I go to an ad agency and pay them for a
logo, that could be two or 3,000 dollars.

265
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,540
Now I could have my kid do something in
powerpoint.

266
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,880
For free and I get my money's worth.
But there's an element

267
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,810
of thinking about

268
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,500
what my options are, and again a, an
interesting option at 295.

269
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,025
What's more interesting is that they run
it as a competition model

270
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,430
[COUGH],

271
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:14,280
meaning that I specify I, am opening, a
salon.

272
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,710
I, am serving this type of customer.

273
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,220
I'm selling this type of product, at this
kind of price point.

274
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,350
I like red.

275
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,920
So, you can give some parameters of what
it is you would like to see in your logo.

276
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,240
You post that.

277
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,540
And then if you have five logo designers
that are members of the sight,

278
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,670
they can elect to create one or more logos

279
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,840
based on the specs that I've created for
them.

280
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,230
And if I choose one as the winner, if I
choose

281
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,850
yours as the winner, you get the $295,
minus a few percent.

282
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,050
That 99 designs keeps.
What do the other four get?

283
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,210
>> Nothing.
>> Nothing.

284
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,090
It's a competition.

285
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,100
Why do five people design when there's
going to be but one winner?

286
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,100
>>

287
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,060
[COUGH]

288
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,714
>> Try and

289
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:07,092
[INAUDIBLE]

290
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:10,320
>> They want to be the winner.
They want to be the winner.

291
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,610
So you see these other competition type
sites That have emerged.

292
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,450
Now someone probably isn't going to design
a whole website.

293
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,130
Somebody's probably not going to invest
weeks of time,

294
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,600
in a competition model.

295
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,810
But for a logo, how long does it take to
make one of these logos?

296
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,700
>> Couple hours.

297
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,440
Couple hours, yeah.

298
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,580
>> Probably a couple of hours if you

299
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,609
were in the business of being a logo
designer.

300
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,950
At least as a version that you can
promote,

301
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,110
and then if somebody wants to change a
little something

302
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,440
with it, you've got the opportunity to
tweak it a

303
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,380
bit, but it's not days and days of time,
typically.

304
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,780
You can also pay more than 295.
295 may be the minimum.

305
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,380
I can offer 495 for my logo.

306
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,290
What does that do?
>>

307
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,045
[INAUDIBLE]

308
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:11,610
>> You don't get five, you get ten.

309
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,610
Each of those don't submit two logos, they
may submit three of four each.

310
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,160
So again, it's somewhat of a, auction
model, so to speak, of that the more

311
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
you pay, the more interest you're going to
get, and the more options you may have.

312
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,700
And you choose the winner, and or, you
have a little

313
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,520
link that you can send out to friends and
colleagues and

314
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,450
family, and have them vote on what they
like too.

315
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,610
So in that way you can do some voting to
help you determine what you want to pick.

316
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,320
But again, different model of outsourcing,
kind of competition based.

317
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,020
So with outsourcing again, as we've talked
about, you can

318
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,920
save some money, you can focus on what you
do well.

319
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,770
And find other people that do what they do
well.

320
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,190
You also might be able to access people
you

321
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,120
otherwise couldn't find, or get skills you
otherwise wouldn't have.

322
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,700
Also it costs money to hire people.

323
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,919
Even if you're going to pay somebody
$30,000 a

324
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,510
year, you're pending the size of your
company.

325
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,200
Are really going to be paying more like
$40,000.

326
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,700
So

327
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,950
how does a $30,000 salary cost you
$40,000?

328
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,010
Where's the other ten go to?

329
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,978
>> Benefits.
>> Benefits.

330
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,790
Healthcare.
Taxes.

331
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,790
Employment taxes.

332
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,340
If you want them to come to work you have
to have space for them to

333
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,320
sit in and equipment for them to use and
furniture for them to have access to.

334
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
So there's a lot of other added costs.

335
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,000
So you again, by partnerting with people
that do that and can do that elsewhere.

336
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,060
And or do it part time from home, there
might be other cost savings there as well.

337
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,220
There are some risks involved.
Doesn't always work out.

338
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,270
The logos you get aren't always the ones
you want.

339
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,150
The app that somebody built may not be

340
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,440
the app that you thought they were
going to deliver.

341
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,510
So there's again, an awareness of that.

342
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,510
And that's why, with many of these things,
you typically, you typically in

343
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,470
the beginning, with people you're
unfamiliar with,

344
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,370
have small projects at small amounts of

345
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,800
money, and then you can kind of grow and
scale it from there.

346
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,690
What a lot of these sites to, as well with
the Elances and the oDesk, how do you know

347
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:39,840
if work is being done, on your software
development?

348
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,360
Now if your going to check in with them,
once a week.

349
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,500
And by voice.

350
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,900
How do you know that work is being done in
the interim?

351
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,468
Particularly if your paying them by the
hour?

352
00:21:51,468 --> 00:21:54,977
[NOISE]

353
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:57,750
You do.
How do you know?

354
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,210
>> You can do desktop sharing.

355
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,970
>> Okay, you can do desktop sharing and
you

356
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,720
can stay awake all the time, and kind of
watch them.

357
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,240
I'm going to watch you do work.

358
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,580
What's a little bit better than that?

359
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,750
>> I know I use progress reports when I
do stuff like that.

360
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,590
>> So there's some progress reports.

361
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,570
What else might they do?

362
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,590
>> Well, oDesk has it all built in
where,

363
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,720
if you're paying somebody on oDesk, you
get a like, report.

364
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,870
You can see their screen like every ten
minutes, and it breaks down their screen

365
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,140
into like what programs they're using and
you get to see a chart of that.

366
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,600
>> So, you essentially have installed
spyware.

367
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,170
They're taking screenshots.
Every few minutes.

368
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,180
Where you can go in and get a report of

369
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,450
what's happened in the last hour, week,
month, what have you.

370
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,890
However long they've been working with you
as related to your project.

371
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,210
How do you know if you're working at a
company, if you ask

372
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,539
an employee to do something, are they
working on it during that day?

373
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,530
Particularly in this cube environment that
we have,

374
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,710
how do you know if they're doing anything?

375
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,000
Not in the same way.

376
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,330
Of the, we'd be up in arms in the U.S. if
their privacy has been invaded at work.

377
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:13,770
Yeah.

378
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,310
>> Can you check on them?
>> You can keep checking.

379
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,656
>> Do we want to be checked on every
three minutes by our boss?

380
00:23:20,656 --> 00:23:22,534
[CROSSTALK]

381
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,279
It's awkward.

382
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,013
[CROSSTALK]

383
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:29,880
You would, could argue, that with the
Elance and the oDesk

384
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,230
and some of the technology that they use
and have and

385
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,460
that people volunteer to engage in, gives
you better oversight than

386
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,810
we have of our own employees that work in
our own office.

387
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,840
But it's being aware again of what's out
there.

388
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,650
>> The last person that voted for
Leedan, do you know who that is?

389
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,870
>> we'll do it in a minute.

390
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:58,380
so with that way for the outsourcing, what
you want to recognize, is that it happens

391
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,630
in lots of models and it happens in lots
of ways and it doesn't always work out.

392
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,220
You know, there's risk in any kind of
partnership.

393
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,930
there's risks in any kind of relationship.

394
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:16,830
We also want to recognize to what extent
can you change your mind.

395
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,000
Can what extent can you drop off with one

396
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,920
person and start with another person if
need be?

397
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,210
If a person building that app isn't
working out,

398
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,570
are you starting from scratch with the
next person?

399
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,740
And has what money you paid kind of gone?

400
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,690
Or have they built a piece that I can use
that piece in the next piece?

401
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:44,120
So that's why again breaking things into
small projects typically works well.

402
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,920
There are also can be backlash to what you
do.

403
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,780
When you're thinking about outsourcing.

404
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,970
When you're thinking about outsourcing, or
if to outsource.

405
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,970
These are a few critical questions to
consider.

406
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,090
One I would look at is the criticality of
the business function.

407
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,830
If you're a technology company.
If you're a web based company.

408
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:14,080
If people are paying to use, and interact
with your software and your web.

409
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,420
I would probably say you don't

410
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,110
want to outsource your website.

411
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:22,550
You probably need to find people to join
your team that

412
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,740
are in the business of doing that and
doing it well.

413
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,220
If you sell socks and you're in the
business of making

414
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,860
socks, it may make a lot of sense to out
source your website.

415
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,500
That's all you need is something that
looks good, that's kind of brochureware

416
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,660
of what it is.

417
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,320
Maybe you want to have a shopping cart on
your site.

418
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,320
Like the basis of your success, it's not
on how

419
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,040
good your shopping cart is or how good
your site is.

420
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,700
It's the product itself.

421
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,410
So in that way again, it depends on what
you're doing,

422
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,060
and it depends on the criticality of that
to your business.

423
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,600
And that's what this is oriented towards
of how mission critical is it?

424
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,650
If it goes down can

425
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,200
you fix it?

426
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,320
If it doesn't work, is, are you going to
lose customers because of it?

427
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,220
And if the answer's yes, you probably want
to do that

428
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,860
skill and do that resource by the members
of your team.

429
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:26,270
If it's things that are somewhat
interchangeable, if

430
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,030
it's things that are not necessarily
mission critical,

431
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,790
If it's something you need infrequently,
then you

432
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,280
may very well outsource that with some
frequency.

433
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,760
When you think about the nature of the
process,

434
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,280
there's also the question of being able to
recognize.

435
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,870
Is it hard?

436
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:53,220
Or is it easy to tell somebody what it is?
If you have something

437
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,150
that's relatively simple to explain,
that's relatively specific in what and how

438
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:04,820
you need it done, and it's not necessarily
time critical,

439
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,570
that's something that you can hire someone
to do.

440
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,700
That's something that you may very well
outsource very effectively.

441
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,020
If it is complex, if there's a lot

442
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,110
of customization to it, if it's hard to
describe

443
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,400
it, and kind of hard to do it, that maybe
the type of thing that you do in house.

444
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,630
There's the kind of the transfer of it,
related to, somewhat the complexity

445
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,630
I think these go hand in hand a bit of can
you explain what it is you want?

446
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,550
Can you quantify it?

447
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,210
Can you measure it?
Can you validate it?

448
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,940
Sales is something that you could argu,
arguably measure

449
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,280
pretty well, and you can hire an outside
sales team.

450
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,200
And if they sell, they get compensated.

451
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,740
If they don't, they don't.

452
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,290
So it's a clean line of impact or
effectiveness.

453
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,800
There's also the element of the
intellectual property

454
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,290
piece of who owns what, and/or what
happens

455
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,700
if somebody breaks that and runs off with

456
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,140
your patents or with your copyrights or
trademarks.

457
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,220
There's one case of an individual that
made

458
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,860
disposable diapers, no not disposable,
reusable diapers.

459
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:26,660
Reusable diapers, and her model is that
there

460
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,790
is a cloth diaper with snaps, that's on
the

461
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:38,570
exterior and there is a secondary layer of
cloth, that goes on the interior.

462
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:42,290
So if you need to change the diaper, you
unsnap,

463
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,380
then you take the interior part,

464
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,710
dump it if it needs to be dumped.

465
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,670
Otherwise, you put it in to be laundered

466
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,240
later that day, and you replace that
little interior

467
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,180
piece, it's an insole almost and you snap

468
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,965
that diaper back up and you're off and
running.

469
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:04,910
[NOISE]

470
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,190
What do people spend on diapers?
>> I don't know.

471
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,960
>> A lot.

472
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,380
>> I have no idea.
>> It accumulates over time.

473
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,470
It's thousands of dollars per baby.

474
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,620
You might think it's gross to change a
diaper.

475
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,760
That's true if it's a disposable diaper or
if it's a, reusable diaper.

476
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,330
So in that way again the people that are
buying these are concerned about,

477
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,060
is that gross or not?
That comes with the baby.

478
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,290
But what she did, is she found a provider
abroad and before she got her

479
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,920
product I just sold into the market,

480
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,860
she had competitors selling the exact same
thing.

481
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,815
So it does happen.

482
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:51,130
[SOUND]

483
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,990
It does happen.

484
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,220
That if you outsource things, the folks
you are

485
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,285
not familiar with, even if you have a
patent.

486
00:29:59,285 --> 00:30:00,400
[COUGH]

487
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,850
All patents do is give you the right or

488
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,710
the beginning, of what you need with a
lawsuit.

489
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:14,040
You still need to litigate that and
typically hire attorneys to litigate that.

490
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,820
So, it's something to be aware of.
It's something to be cautious of.

491
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:27,709
Particularly too, with fashion and
apparel, hard to get patents that stick,

492
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:31,810
because we can just add a third button.
We can make it an inch longer.

493
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:38,690
It's fuchsia instead of pink.
So again, it's subtle differences.

494
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,910
So it may give people the opportunity to
work around patents.

495
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,850
We also recognize the inventor capability.
So what do people know?

496
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,730
What can they accomplish and do they have
the right skills?

497
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,030
And that's where references come in as
well.

498
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,060
Governance, we talked about that a little
bit.

499
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,540
That's more the contract element.

500
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,140
In summary, when you think about
outsourcing, there are rich

501
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,416
and valuable avenues for new ventures to
engage in this.

502
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:07,890
And the outsourcing opportunities, and the
outsourcing

503
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,528
jobs and roles are widely diverse, and
they exist in many forms.

504
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:18,080
So we can encourage you to think about
that, to think about how you can add value

505
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,040
to your customers, and add value to your

506
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,750
company, by finding the right outsourced
relationships and partnerships.

507
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,300
Also think about the risk.

508
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,730
There are inevitably risks when you do
anything with any one else.

509
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,620
But there some best practices as discussed
here

510
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,800
that you can try to mitigate those risks.

511
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,420
That you can think

512
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,340
about how do I select the right partners
in the beginning and then how

513
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,780
do I put a process in place

514
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,590
to manage those outsourced relationships
effectively and effeciently.
