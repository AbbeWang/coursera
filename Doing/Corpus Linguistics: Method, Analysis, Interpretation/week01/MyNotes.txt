Part1 - Why use a corpus?

Why use a corpus?
- large amounts/collection of data tell us about tendencies and what's normal or typical in real-life language use
- corpora also reveal instances of very rar or exceptional cases, that we wouldn't get from looking at single texts or introspection
- human researchers make mistakes and are slow. computers are much quicker and more accurate
- the computer allows us to do it swiftly and reliably, 

Design criteria:
- Research question crucially determines whether that corpus is going to be useful to or not
Criteria in building a corpus
- it must be a large body of text (depending on the needs/ purpose)
- it needs to be representative of language (or a genre of language)
- must be in machine-readable form (e.g. txt files on a computer - the computer must be able to analise the individual words)
- acts as a standard reference about what's typical in language (it can act as some type of nominal standard reference about what is typical in a language, if the corpus is built to be broadly representative of the language - e.g. British National Corpus, which had the aim of being broadly representative of British English)
- often annotated with additional linguistic information - e.g. grammatical codes

we can use mark-up to improve the quality of your searches through the data
