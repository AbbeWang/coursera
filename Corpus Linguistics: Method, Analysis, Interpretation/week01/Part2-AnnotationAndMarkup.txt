Part 2: annotation and mark-up

Tony McEnery gives a brief overview of how corpus texts may be enriched with additional information to ease analysis.

Note that this type of additional information may be called ‘mark up’, ‘annotation’, or ‘tagging’. All three terms are near synonyms. Annotation usually refers to linguistic information encoded in a corpus - however, the encoding is achieved using a mark-up language. Similarly, the annotation itself is usually undertaken by putting so called tags - short codes to indicate some linguistics feature - into a text. Hence, while the terms can be separated, they can also be used inter-changeably!

One final note - an xml tag finishes with a forward slash rather than a back slash.
