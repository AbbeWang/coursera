1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,160
Today we are going to talk about Exploring
Real Market Needs.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,670
And I want to emphasis the term real here
and

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,150
that often times that have students that
have an idea they

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,850
came up with they dreamt about it, they
thought about it

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,840
in the shower it just was a kind of an
Piffany.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,120
But it may not be a real need and so with
that we are going to look at today.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,950
Is how you begin to try and segment the
things that are real market

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,320
needs from the things that might be novel
ideas but perhaps there's not a

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,530
market opportunity for it.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,020
Specifically, when we look at building a
successful company.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,140
We want to introduce a product or service
that, satisfies

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,330
customer needs or wants in a better way
than competitors.

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,310
And again, we'll use the terms needs and
wants somewhat interchangeably.

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,710
Many of us buy more of what we want versus
what we need.

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,540
But there's also a lot of interchange
within that.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,390
so in that way again, when we talk about

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,570
needs and wants we're kind of combing in
the terms and using them synonymously.

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,150
The other piece of the equation when we
determine what to buy is that of price.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,620
And it's not necessarily the cheapest

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,390
price, it's not necessarily the highest
price.

21
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,260
But it's a price that the company has set
that's something that makes sense for its

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,270
business model and the value proposition
for it's

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,870
customers and it's needs and wants that
they're fulfilling.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,600
So in that way

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,120
when we being to think about real market
needs, we're going to look at

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,040
both sides of this of both the need or the
want of the customer.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,360
But as well as how do you price things
appropriately.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,390
So in that way when we think about
understanding needs

29
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,860
it's a question of is there a problem
that's unsolved.

30
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,945
And we've talked about this company square
space,

31
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:40,600
[SOUND]

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,430
that has the hundred employees that is
valued at over $100 million.

33
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:51,130
And it came with, again, a computer
science student being

34
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,930
unhappy with the existing web publishing
tools that were out there.

35
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,180
And he built something, not with the
intent of starting

36
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,480
a company, he built something to help him
build websites easy.

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,040
He had some ideas and some thoughts on
creating

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,650
multiple websites.

39
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,850
He didn't want to do them all from
scratch.

40
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,590
So he started building a series of tools
that he could use.

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,020
He showed it to his friend.

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,650
Friend said, that's pretty cool.
I'll pay you $500 for that.

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,510
What did he think then?

44
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,410
There might be other people that I can
sell this to.

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,738
And so in that way I can solve his own
problem.

46
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:39,180
Google, same thing, they did not sit down
intending to start a company.

47
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,660
They didn't write a business plan
intending to start a company.

48
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,850
They were students doing research, wanted

49
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,080
to have a more effective search
technology,

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,500
built that for themselves.

51
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,970
Friends started using it, classmates
started using it, campus started using it,

52
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,740
and then later, the thought was, we could
build a business on this.

53
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,460
So again, solving your own problem can
often be a starting point.

54
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,600
And again, thinking about a better way.

55
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,610
And there is some industries that, again,
had not evolved for a long time.

56
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,750
The rental car market had not evolved for
a long time.

57
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,740
Until the zip cars and, again, these other

58
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,780
aspects of being able to have a
distributed

59
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,150
easy pick up drop off, low price, rent by
the hour, instead of rent by the day.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,580
If you need to go to the grocery store,
you probably don't want to pay 24

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,800
hours of rental car pricing to do that.

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,110
You might want to pay and hour or two and

63
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,149
that's what zip car does, you pay by the
hour.

64
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,620
And again pricing and we again use the
word better pricing.

65
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,070
And not necessarily lower pricing.

66
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,090
Few of us will go into a store and say,
I'm going

67
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,820
to buy the cheapest shampoo, the cheapest
milk and the cheapest underwear.

68
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,270
We're looking at pricing.

69
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,100
We might not necessarily go in and say,
oh,

70
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,570
I'm just going to buy the most expensive
of everything.

71
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,590
But we think about what

72
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,160
do I like,

73
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,840
perhaps ingredients, we pay attention to
the branding.

74
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,020
Do we like the colors?

75
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,550
Do we like the shape?

76
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,330
Do we like the feature and the function?
And that influence is our decision, so

77
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:35,160
price influences but its all undo you'd
necessarily decide on the cheapest.

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,080
So how do you see these needs and how to

79
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,220
do you recognize that and, and again its
important to recognize

80
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,060
that being a little bit better is a start

81
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,615
up probably isn't enough, why is that the
case?

82
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:50,330
If you like a brand, if you like a
product, if

83
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,950
you like a piece of apparel, if you like a
certain beverage.

84
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,952
What would make you switch?
What would make you switch away?

85
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:08,410
>> Something that's, else is a similar,
a similar product.

86
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,785
>> Okay.
>> Getting better and it's, has better

87
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:13,431
[INAUDIBLE]

88
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:13,643
>> Okay.
>>

89
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:14,314
[INAUDIBLE]

90
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,900
>> So there's something that's, you
know, an improvement,

91
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,570
and a noticeable improvement over what you
already have.

92
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,620
Typically if you are happy with what you
already have it's going to take something

93
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,330
to really get you over the edge and they
get you transition out of that.

94
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,315
But if its something you've never had
before

95
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:31,960
[SOUND]

96
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,400
and this is where, again, what we're
talking about with first mover advantages.

97
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,720
If it's something you've never had before,
or if it's a new

98
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,920
problem that you've identified, you don't
have to steal your competitors customers.

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:56,373
Everybody's looking for something to enter
into the, a part of.

100
00:05:56,373 --> 00:06:03,830
So, oftentimes in trying to get a feel for
what's a real need, we look for problems.

101
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,495
We don't necessarily ask somebody, would
you like a product that did this?

102
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,985
You're trying to get a sense of

103
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:11,050
[UNKNOWN]

104
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,140
for existing products or existing problems
that are

105
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,810
out there, where you are having some
issues.

106
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,220
So, there is a department on

107
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,980
campus, called The Fischell Department of
Bioengineering.

108
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,610
There is a person named Robert Fischell.

109
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,660
He is an inventor.

110
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,230
Predominately in biomedical and medical
devices.

111
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,060
And he goes to doctors, he goes to
hospitals,

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:43,140
he goes to ER's, he ask doctor's what's
your problem?

113
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,090
Why does he do that?
>> See how he can help them?

114
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,900
>> See how he can help.

115
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,540
What procedures are you doing that you
don't have the right equipment?

116
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,080
What types of measurements are you trying
to do that you're not

117
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,460
getting a lot of accuracy, or a lot of
reliability, in those measurements?

118
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,160
Are there things that you do on a regular
basis that are awkward?

119
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,540
And I'm going to go home and invent
something for you.

120
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,480
And he has, I think, upwards of 300
patents.

121
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,790
So far he's contributed $31 million to the
university.

122
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,995
What's that tell you when someone can
donate $31 million?

123
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:26,995
>>

124
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,073
[UNKNOWN]

125
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,459
[CROSSTALK]

126
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,878
>> They have at least 31, and probably a
fair amount more than that.

127
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:38,290
He builds nothing.

128
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,480
He manufactures nothing.
He sells no product.

129
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,580
How do you get wealthy by doing that?

130
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,010
>> He comes up with the idea and sells
the idea.

131
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,450
>> He sent, essentially licenses the
concepts.

132
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,310
Doesn't necessarily license the idea, but
licenses the invention.

133
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,334
So if you're going to have a heart

134
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:03,610
[SOUND]

135
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,590
stint, something that's going to be
implanted in

136
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,760
your heart, and it's going to hold open,

137
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,970
channels for blood to flow in.
Why might you want to license that?

138
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,330
Two large companies that are in that
business versus going at it on your own.

139
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,150
>> The large companies, I mean, they
probably have

140
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,560
more money, more resources to start a
business, I mean.

141
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,160
>> They have the tens of millions of
dollars that it takes.

142
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,080
To go through and do the research, to do
the clinical trials, to work with the FDA,

143
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,310
to roll that out, to commercialize it.
And if you were in the business

144
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,490
of looking for a heart stent, are you
going to buy Bob's Heart Stents?

145
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,600
So there's a branding element there as
well, you

146
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,800
tend to buy from the companies that you
know.

147
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,490
And he's done it again, fundamentally, by
going

148
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,290
in and talking to doctors about what they
need.

149
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,060
And keeps delivering solutions to them.

150
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,790
So what we can do in a fairly efficient
way,

151
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,110
as we have ideas, you can talk with
customers directly.

152
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,410
But what you see here is if you go to
Amazon, search

153
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,620
on any product that you wish, then you'll
see some level of returns.

154
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:28,000
So for this I searched on iPhone 5 speaker
docks, and I get upwards of 9,000 results.

155
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,630
And with these and again, if you've
searched on Amazon before you know that

156
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,650
you can go, you can search, you can find,
you can search by category.

157
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,170
You can read about the product, you can
see a picture, you can see a price.

158
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,130
What else do you see?

159
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,670
>> How the reviews of the product.
>> You see reviews of the product.

160
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,410
And in this scenario for this first
product I have 192 reviews.

161
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,270
For the second product I have 1,305.
For the third product

162
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,910
I have 366.
So add those up and you're

163
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,100
approaching 2,000 reviews of people that
bought,

164
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,240
own and have used these iPhone 5 speaker
docks.

165
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,970
How else would I get 2,000 people to tell
me what they like and what they

166
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,020
dislike about an iPhone 5 speaker doc.
If I don't do this,

167
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,930
what else can I do?
>> You can ask them.

168
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,050
>> Who is them?

169
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,569
>> Customers of iPhone 5.
>> How do you find them?

170
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,580
>> You go to the store.
>> You go to the store?

171
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,495
>> Yeah.
>> So Best Buy,

172
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:50,560
[CROSSTALK]

173
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,970
they're going to let you post up shop?
>> Yeah.

174
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,112
>> No.
>>

175
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,125
[UNKNOWN]

176
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:55,944
[LAUGH].

177
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:56,885
>> So again can't,

178
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:57,680
[COUGH]

179
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,220
with any degree of scale or reliability,
go to retailers.

180
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,090
They're not going to tell you information
about their customers.

181
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,610
And customers probably aren't going to
take the time to talk to you.

182
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,630
>> I say, go to the discussion

183
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,270
boards online the Apple discussion boards
where they.

184
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,960
>> OK.
You could do something similar.

185
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,770
So, you could go to the retailers and see
how consumers have rated products.

186
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,740
Or, you could to the enthusiest sites, the
Apple discussion boards.

187
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,490
So, again, another platform.

188
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,670
I've let you go online and find people
talking about these products.

189
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,970
>> You could establish a customer
service line.

190
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,730
>> Say again.
>> Establish a customer service line.

191
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,095
>> OK.
How does that work?

192
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:40,690
>> well customers would call the phone
line

193
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,510
for any complaints they have about the
product.

194
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,720
>> OK.

195
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,510
How were they going to get your
information to call you and

196
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,250
how were you going to resolve their
problem?

197
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,910
>> Well, you could post the number
online, something like a website.

198
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,280
>> Post the number online.
So take a step back again.

199
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,670
You have an idea for entering this market.
So you're not in the market yet.

200
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,950
You're trying to figure out if I were to
enter this market and design an

201
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,250
iPhone 5 speaker dock, what should be

202
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,460
the features, the functions, the price
point, etc.

203
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,570
So again, you're at

204
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,540
a point that you're not equipped to solve
problems.

205
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,620
You haven't sold any product yet.

206
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,920
You're simply just trying to understand.

207
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,110
What do people like and dislike about the
products?

208
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,740
>> Like when they have to register it
like for a

209
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,880
warranty or something like that having to
fill out a survey.

210
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,330
>> But you're jumping ahead of it.

211
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,700
So and, what I mean by this is that for

212
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:39,120
Logitech, the middle brand here, or for
Bose you're both right.

213
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,180
If I'm Logitech I should have a customer
service line to resolve complaints.

214
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,800
If I'm Logitech, I should have a product
warranty registration system.

215
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
But I'm saying, if you want to compete

216
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,780
against Logitech, if want to compete
against Bose,

217
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,630
how do you get customers to tell you

218
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,800
how they feel about your competitors
products and services?

219
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,340
>> Telemarketing.
>> Telemarketing.

220
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,920
How do you find people that are owners of
these products?

221
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,322
>> Just randomly call people?
I don't know

222
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:07,620
[LAUGH].

223
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,570
>> Randomly call people.

224
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,190
How many people here have an iPhone 5
speaker dock?

225
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,370
>> I have one.
>> So, perhaps three.

226
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:24,660
So for every thousand phone calls we make,
we find 10% of the people even have it.

227
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,440
Somebody calls you and wants to talk to
you about

228
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,990
your iPhone 5 speaker dock, are you
going to talk to them?

229
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,872
>> No.
>> Then of the

230
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:31,975
[CROSSTALK]

231
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:35,780
10% that answered the phone, none of them
are going to talk to us.

232
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:35,780
>>

233
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,080
[LAUGH]

234
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,510
[UNKNOWN]

235
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,210
>> And there's an expense

236
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,270
[COUGH].

237
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,380
It costs money to do that.
This free, aside from you time.

238
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:52,790
What else do we do when we go out and are
considering a higher item purchase?

239
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,650
If your going to spend a couple

240
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,820
hundred dollars on something, particularly
electronics.

241
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,710
What do you typically do?

242
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,400
>> Get cheaper better alternatives.

243
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,330
>> But how do you decide which ones you
want to buy?

244
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,520
>> You go to the store and try it first.
>> You go to the store and try it out.

245
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,230
What else should you do?
>> Ask

246
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,690
your friends.
>> Ask friends.

247
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,310
What else?
>> Reviews.

248
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,160
>> You look for reviews.

249
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,920
And so in that way not only might you look

250
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,670
at consumer reviews, but you look at the
expert reviews.

251
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,160
You look at the reviews that are written
by the magazines that

252
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,170
cover automotives or electronics or
refrigerators

253
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,640
or whatever it is that you're considering.

254
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:37,010
But again, the expert reviews give you
some perspective

255
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,670
that I'd rather have 2,000 people tell me
their experience as a user over time.

256
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,970
One fault with a lot of the expert reviews
is they're reviewing the new product.

257
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,550
They don't necessarily review the product
after it's

258
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,990
been used for six months or a year.

259
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,950
So in that way, again, very valuable to go
in and do this type

260
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,380
of thing when you can through and find
people that are owners, that are users,

261
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,410
that do it relatively real time, en mass.
And you have a big volume of content here.

262
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,660
That you're able to work with, and you can
go in too, and

263
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:19,150
read these individual reviews, and you can
see most helpful or favorable reviews.

264
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,090
You would read the critical reviews, you
could see some scale

265
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,820
of how many people really liked it, how
many people didn't like.

266
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,300
And you can get a lot of good information
this way on

267
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,220
the cheap and relatively fast.

268
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,860
You don't have to build a survey, you
don't have to

269
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,140
worry about how do I find people that own
these products.

270
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,290
And if I find them how do I incentivize
them to respond

271
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,690
you simply go and, and see what do people
like, and don't like.

272
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,780
What's the problem with doing your
research this way, and only this way?

273
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,800
>> You

274
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,590
have a biased set of people.
>> You may have a biased set of people.

275
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,896
And some people criticize Yelp, and some
of these other platforms,

276
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:02,409
[INAUDIBLE]

277
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,864
if I'm a restaurant owner.

278
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,280
Am I just going to go in once a day, and
give my restaurant a five star rating?

279
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,330
>> yeah.

280
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,770
>> And, that's difficult to manage.

281
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:18,440
So there might be some element of fraud
invovled with it, to be mindful of.

282
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,470
Any other problems with this?
>> Yep.

283
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,110
If you had a faulty product that didn't
work.

284
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,990
You don't know necessarily that
representativeness of what they're saying.

285
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,980
That they did a product when they pulled
them out the mailbox, they dropped it.

286
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,170
And then when they took it in their home,
and opened it up, it was broken.

287
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,600
So, again, there's some element of

288
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,620
it being somewhat of an uncontrolled
environment.

289
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:43,825
Yep.
>>

290
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,120
[UNKNOWN]

291
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,146
reviews like you have

292
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:46,320
[SOUND]

293
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,290
different views on it, so its like
inconsistent.

294
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:49,420
>> Okay.

295
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:49,420
>>

296
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,754
[UNKNOWN]

297
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:53,780
>> There's some level of inconsistency.

298
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:00,950
in this model, we see out of 1300, its at
about 4 1/2 stars on a 5 star scale.

299
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,109
So we see some measure of consistency, and
we see kind of an even curve.

300
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,120
Where there are 50 and 30 and 70 people
that really didn't like it but

301
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,862
300 and 800 that do so you want to look at
all of the above.

302
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:16,510
You want to get some sense

303
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,080
of, for the ones that like, what themes
are central

304
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,130
and I might want to incorporate those
elements into my design.

305
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,470
And for the ones that don't like, are
there things there,

306
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,340
that I can recognize and perhaps solve or
resolve in your design?

307
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,268
>> I was just going to say the, this
market is only showing people who first of

308
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:39,369
all have using the Internet and are also
willing to go back and review it.

309
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:41,200
>> Okay.
>> They're going to get less people.

310
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,530
>> So

311
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,540
what's a smaller population of it's people
that are taking the time to do.

312
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,640
And you tend to see people that are

313
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,260
doing this type of commenting on the outer
bounds.

314
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,860
People that are really happy, take the
time to make comment.

315
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,090
People that are very dissatisfied, take
the time to make comment.

316
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,420
If you bought it, then it's okay and it
does what you thought it would.

317
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,400
You probably, on average not going to take
the time to review.

318
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,740
So, again, it's some

319
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,405
of those survey

320
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:07,550
[UNKNOWN]

321
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,950
to think about.

322
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,720
But in the absence of what your other
options are, of I'm

323
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,178
not exactly sure how you would affordably
fined owners, particularly 2000 owners.

324
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:22,350
To get 2,000 pieces of feedback on an
iPhone 5 speaker dock.

325
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,960
If not to do things like this.

326
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,560
So, helpful in understanding market,
understand the need.

327
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,970
So, again, all that factors into being
able to

328
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,670
think about, I've got an idea, I've got a
concept.

329
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,830
Let me go out do a little bit of research,
see

330
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,870
what consumers think about it and so
that's our starting point.

331
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,946
And from there it's an element of well
what can I do?

332
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:45,080
How do I build?
How do I develop?

333
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,000
What do I do about it?

334
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,350
And what's the future of that and how are
things involving?

335
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,080
And in that platform it gives you the
opportunity to go out

336
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,130
and do a bit more further

337
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,079
research together information about
customer preferences.

338
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:58,079
>>

339
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,490
[COUGH]

340
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,710
>> And at that stage you can think about

341
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,490
the element of groups and surveys and
focus groups.

342
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,140
Anybody been in a focus group?

343
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,650
You know what I mean by focus group?

344
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,910
And what's a focus group?

345
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,810
>> A focus group is a bunch of people
who

346
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,420
are selected by a company who wants to do
product testing.

347
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,760
>> Okay.
What's a bunch?

348
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,635
>> people who they believe.
>> What's a number?

349
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:29,900
>> it can be anywhere from like six to,
I'd say, even 100.

350
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,220
>> Okay.

351
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,990
Tends to be relatively small groups.

352
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,160
So single digits, maybe a few dozen
people.

353
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,140
But the orientation of let's put people in
a room as

354
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,590
a group, and talk to them about their
experiences likes, dislikes, etc.

355
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,870
And the idea there it's a bit more
informal, you began to see

356
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,460
where people are feeding off one another
side.

357
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,630
There was contributed in the things.

358
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,290
Different than an interview which is
typically a one to one

359
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,830
and interview different than a survey is
surveys are often written.

360
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,810
And with those surveys typically they are
objective, and that you're checking

361
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,020
the box, you're agreeing, you're
disagreeing,

362
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,900
you're rating things on a scale.

363
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,860
Interviews, a little more open-ended.

364
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,620
You can respond, you can inquire, you can
ask

365
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,340
why, and what, and how, in a different
way.

366
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,930
And so all of those are things you can do

367
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,020
to get some sense of what they've done,
what they're doing.

368
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,870
And what are they thinking about you?

369
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,160
And in that way it helps to either
validate that the idea

370
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,450
that you have is indeed a good idea, and a
marketable idea perhaps.

371
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,030
Versus something that might have been an
interesting concept,

372
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,040
but there might not be a market for it.

373
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,380
At least in its current conception.

374
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,920
When you go through and think about where
how do I find data.

375
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,740
How do I find Market Research.

376
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,820
And there are endless resources for that.

377
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,250
this is part of list of tools that Steve

378
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,150
Blank who is active in

379
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,120
the entrepreneurship education spaces
identified.

380
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,910
And these are a few that I would start
with that gives you some sense of

381
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,700
broadly research on public companies, how
large are

382
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,240
markets, how many dollars are spent in
certain

383
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,735
industries, geographies, things of that
nature.

384
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:24,735
>>

385
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:25,384
[COUGH]

386
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:29,670
>> You can learn about website traffic
and populations and tranges and growth.

387
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,610
From there you can go through and look at
specific business statistics, so

388
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,760
there are different sets of databases that
are geared toward things, like census.

389
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,890
What's the census?

390
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,880
>> When the, when a government counts up
how many people

391
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,400
that there are in a population.
>> Okay.

392
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,610
>> Area.

393
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,030
>> So, census looks and things like
population

394
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,560
by area, by geography by zip code by age.

395
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,040
>> Yeah.
Now.

396
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,820
It just, I mean.

397
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,820
Look it has a bunch of stats of the nation
as a whole and different ethnicities.

398
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,070
>> Okay.

399
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,745
>> So.

400
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:13,000
>> So they're looking at gender.
They're looking at education.

401
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,980
So a host of different stats.

402
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,570
Why does that matter?

403
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,732
Why might you for a given zip code want to
know about the people there?

404
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:21,732
>>

405
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:23,890
[COUGH]

406
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,430
it's so you can target a certain group of
people like elders.

407
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,080
>> Okay.

408
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,285
So if you're considering serving a certain
market, either locating operations there.

409
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:37,550
Or selling your product there.

410
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,270
Or investing your money in marketing
dollars there.

411
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,930
You want to know well, who is there?

412
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,270
And who are they?

413
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,900
This is a central way that restaurants
decide where to locate, this is

414
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,780
the central way that they decide where do
we

415
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,730
build malls, where are we going to locate
new apartment buildings?

416
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,140
It's, what's the population that's there?

417
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,020
How has it changed?

418
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,430
And then doing some analysis and thinking
about, how is it going to change?

419
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,920
there's also data that load side venture
capital the PwC MoneyTree is a big one.

420
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,210
And with that you can see for free, and
all of these are free resources,

421
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,820
you can see.

422
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,200
Where are venture capitalists putting
their money?

423
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,900
What types of industries?

424
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,750
What geographies?
How many companies did they invest in?

425
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,990
What was the stage of those companies?

426
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,860
How much did they invest on average per
company, per industry, per region?

427
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,530
And so in that way, it gives you some

428
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,820
sense of what's going on in the market
space.

429
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,520
Lot's of other.

430
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,370
Resources that are there and all these are
links

431
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,396
that you can go back to for later.

432
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:45,428
so with all of these links, you can go in
and see things on a national level,

433
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:47,796
an an international level, of being able
to

434
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:51,570
capture and understand what's going on in
these markets.

435
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,350
So, again, pages and pages of links.

436
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,090
That you can use based on what it is
you're trying to do, where

437
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,580
you're trying to do it but there's no
shortage of market data out there.

438
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,420
In many cases

439
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:09,990
governments and states are investing in
measuring this.

440
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,840
Why do they do that?

441
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,110
Why does the county or state, put dozens

442
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,475
or hundreds of people to work collecting
data

443
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:22,110
[SOUND]

444
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,010
on this type of thing.

445
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,775
>> I mean, I know, at least for some
people, at least my

446
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:27,840
[INAUDIBLE]

447
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,759
that he looks for the stats more to that's

448
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,970
[UNKNOWN]

449
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,120
case community.
>> Okay.

450
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,580
So there's an element of when it comes to
things like federal aid programs.

451
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,780
When it comes to things like economic
development.

452
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,390
When it comes to attracting businesses
they want to

453
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,630
have a good representation of here's who
we are.

454
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,195
And here's why we would be a good fit for
what it is that they're trying to attract.

455
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:53,195
>>

456
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:55,160
[SOUND]

457
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,400
well, ultimately it'll benefit them like
economically and

458
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,970
financially because if they because if
they give

459
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,260
the data then they'll track certain
businesses into

460
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,440
that state so they would get, and with
taxes.

461
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,600
>> Yep.

462
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,750
So if you, you can say here is the income

463
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,380
profile of our folks, here's the education
profile of our folks.

464
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,040
Here's a number of people that we have.

465
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,850
Here's a number of perhaps young people
that we

466
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,310
have, if that's a market that people are
targeting.

467
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,000
So in that way,

468
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,300
they spend a lot of time doing that, and
they make it publically available.

469
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,270
Again, available to you as well, to be
able to

470
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,509
go through and see what's going on in the
market.

471
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,270
So with that you can do a lot of things,
you can have a lot

472
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,840
of idea, you can go through and you can
recognize that there are market needs.

473
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,190
You can do some research and validate
those needs but,

474
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,260
then there is a question of what do I do?

475
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,150
I have my iPhone 5 speaker dock idea.

476
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,580
And I've gone through, and I have 30
things, that people want.

477
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,490
If I ask you if you like something, you
may say

478
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,870
yes, if I tell you what it costs, your
mind may change.

479
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,470
So it gives you the opportunity to say, do
you like this set

480
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,180
of futures for this price, or this set of
futures for this price?

481
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,990
And again, you're doing this all before
you have manufactured

482
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,930
a thing.

483
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,300
You're doing this all before you have
prototyped anything.

484
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,630
You're still in the process of trying to

485
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,520
understand what is that is that we should
desire.

486
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,020
And what products and services make sense
for

487
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,340
the market that we're trying to compete
in.

488
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,720
And in that way that's what we

489
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,610
mean by this separation and ranking of
preferences.

490
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,620
And that it gives you some sense of what
exactly do you want to do.

491
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,990
So in summary when you're beginning to
think

492
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,730
about entrepreneurial ideas, we want to
recognize and

493
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,130
try to seek those real needs and wants.

494
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,550
And we also want to recognize the role
that price plays,

495
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,610
as we consider what we might want to bring
to the market.

496
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,580
The way that we do that is first to
research creatively.

497
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,740
So you may not necessarily have the time
or budget to do elaborate market research.

498
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,460
But through some of the tools and
techniques that we've talked about today,

499
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,100
it gives you some insights on what you can
do with reasonable accuracy,

500
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,640
fairly quickly and fairly affordably.

501
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,830
What you're also going to need to do is
use some of your own intuition.

502
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,390
So in that way if you're truly doing
something

503
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,170
innovative by definition it should be a
bit new.

504
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,350
And maybe there are competitors out there
now

505
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,300
or in the past that you can learn from.

506
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,520
But at the end of the day you're probably
going to be trying to bring

507
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,685
some things to market that you're not

508
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,810
going to find perfect market research to
align with.

509
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,735
And so, you're applying some of your own

510
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:33,035
experiences, you're applying some of your
own background, you're

511
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:33,420
[UNKNOWN]

512
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,235
applying some of your own know-how and

513
00:27:35,235 --> 00:27:38,670
analysis to evaluate the research that
you're finding.

514
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,384
And then lastly, and arguably the most
importantly,

515
00:27:41,384 --> 00:27:43,706
is to think about market segments and
niches.

516
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:46,982
And we'll talk about this a little bit
later but find a mine way

517
00:27:46,982 --> 00:27:47,423
[UNKNOWN]

518
00:27:47,423 --> 00:27:51,061
think about is the specific market.
And now our market that you've

519
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:51,495
[UNKNOWN]

520
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:52,549
serve, that you can

521
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,983
[UNKNOWN]

522
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:54,347
brand there, that you can

523
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:54,781
[UNKNOWN]

524
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:59,120
our customer and that you can build your
skills and abilities and capabilities.

525
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,246
So

526
00:27:59,246 --> 00:27:59,687
[UNKNOWN]

527
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:02,880
in bigger markets later but it gives you a
foothold.

528
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,470
And, it gives you an entryway into
entering a market and you can

529
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,840
even specialize within that, and a better
way than many of the existing competitors.
