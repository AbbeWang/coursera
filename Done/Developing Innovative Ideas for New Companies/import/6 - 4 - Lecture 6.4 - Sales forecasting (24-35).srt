1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,488
Today we're going to discuss sales
forecasting.

2
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:09,805
And this is something that I see as a
critical challenge for many entrepreneurs.

3
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:12,016
And it's very difficult to try and make

4
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:14,897
a reasonable forecast of what are your
sales, what

5
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:16,974
are your revenues going to be a year from

6
00:00:16,974 --> 00:00:19,849
now, two years from now, three years from
now.

7
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:24,083
For a product that you haven't built for a
market that you've researched, which

8
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,577
you haven't yet entered, and versus
competitors

9
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:28,586
that you have not yet competed against.

10
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:29,066
So in that

11
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:31,826
way, we'll look at some tools and some
techniques for

12
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:34,530
how to make these sales forecast for a new
venture.

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,300
Fundamentally, we'll talk about what are
some business models

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,110
and business plan impacts and how does the
sales forecast

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,660
impact your model and your plan and why is

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,470
a good sales forecast necessary to have a
convincing plan.

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,150
We'll also examine how to forecast these
sales and how

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,950
to set some revenue goals.

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,130
And we'll work through some, what I
believe to

20
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,360
be novel approaches to that, that help
with understanding

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,030
the target profits of your company and
then working

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,770
backwards from there, to get to your sales
forecast.

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,110
We want to recognize that, again, you're
doing this to plan your

24
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,110
business because based on how much you
think you're going to sell,

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,560
it's going to really dictate how you're
going to build the company.

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,390
How many people you need, what types of
resources

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,900
you need, what your expenses are going to
be as well.

28
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,850
And so the orientation of that is, that
sales is typically the starting point

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,800
of building out the rest of your income
statement and the rest of your financials.

30
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,290
We want sales to be high, typically,
because we want

31
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,250
them to be convincing to investors,
convincing to lenders.

32
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,640
But what happens if they're too high?

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,850
What happens if we come in and we

34
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,550
say we're going to sell a million this
year, or

35
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,360
5 million this year, or 10 million this
year

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,400
and we don't have anything to back it up?

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,180
>> so they're not going to believe you?

38
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,360
>> There's an element of feasibility.
There's an element of reality.

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,260
if you think you can sell a million, or
you

40
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,630
think you can sell 5 million, and you have
a plan

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,260
to get there, and your plan is logical and
rational then you can certainly do that.

42
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,607
But it's important, again, to recognize
that depending on where you're going to

43
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:20,246
get money from there might be some
expectations of what they have.

44
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:22,952
Investors are typically looking for big
returns

45
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:25,592
and so they're looking for pretty rapid
growth.

46
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,404
Banks, somewhere in the middle they want
you

47
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:30,924
to be able to pay back whatever you lend.

48
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:32,706
But they don't need you to

49
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:36,082
necessarily be on the cover of Fortune in
a year.

50
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:40,460
If it's your money, you can move at
kind of the pace that you want to move at.

51
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,443
So again, the type of financial capital
you have will dictate sales

52
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:44,436
[UNKNOWN]

53
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:44,982
as well.

54
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:48,460
But again, fundamentally, for most
ventures, be

55
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,040
it profit or non-profit, you need to
generate

56
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,640
enough sales to help the company be
successful

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,967
and to reach the goals that you have.

58
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:59,550
So we're going to look at the income
statement

59
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,610
as a tool for how to develop sales
forecasts.

60
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,150
So there are a lot of financial statements
that are

61
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,370
out there and we'll talk about some of
those later.

62
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,890
They're normally the income statement, the
balance sheet, the cash flow statement and

63
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,170
we'll talk about how those fit within
business plans.

64
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,640
But what we see within the income

65
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,670
statement is at the top line, there's
revenue.

66
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,060
What are we going to do in sales?

67
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,300
Typically on a quarterly, or annual basis,
there are cost of goods

68
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,550
sold, which is, in a large part,
manufacturing cost or production cost.

69
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,452
What's it take to produce that individual
unit that we're selling.

70
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:35,230
There's SG and

71
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,450
A, which is selling, general and
administrative, and a

72
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,060
big piece of that is the marketing and
sales costs.

73
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,610
So, selling cost include marketing as
well.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,390
And when you begin to think about what are

75
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,090
the different pieces of the expenses, you
add those up.

76
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,960
You get some sense of timeline, of what

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,660
are we going to spend, for what purpose,
and

78
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,840
that guides you towards the answer of how
much money do you need to start the firm.

79
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,910
Profits or

80
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,690
the result revenues minus expenses, taxes
will be taken out of that as well.

81
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,910
Revenues and sales, again, synonymous
terms,

82
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,060
means the same thing for our purposes.

83
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,520
So that's your price per unit times number
sold.

84
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,770
Expenses come in a few different ways.

85
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,940
There are variable expenses, meaning that
for every unit

86
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,590
of production, I have some cost associated
with that.

87
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,100
There's material costs, there's labor

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,610
costs, there's energy costs, so there's
other costs that I incur for every unit

89
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,380
produced or sold.
There are fixed costs, one time costs.

90
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,994
What are a one time cost for a cafe?
What kind of cost am I incurring one time?

91
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:47,355
>> The coffee machine?
>> I may be buying equipment.

92
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:52,284
And that equipment might not last forever,
but it's probably

93
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:56,320
going to last years, or 5 years, or 10
years.

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,150
So it's largely one time.

95
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,799
What other one time costs am I incurring?

96
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,510
There's equipment, there's.
>> real estate if you're buying.

97
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,910
>> Okay, if you going to buy the
property, you have

98
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,640
a land cost, a building cost, that's
going to be one time.

99
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,400
If you're going to rent the property, it's
going to be a recurring fixed cost.

100
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,600
You sign your lease, it's $3000 a month,
you pay that each and every month.

101
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,770
If you sell no product, you pay $3000.

102
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,150
If you

103
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,280
sell millions of product, you pay $3000.

104
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,440
So in that way, again, we have fixed costs

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,132
that are one time, but they also might be
interval.

106
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:41,110
What about labor?
What kind of cost is labor?

107
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,120
>> Isn't labor variable?

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,090
>> It's variable, so based on how much I
sell,

109
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,490
I'm going to decide how much I'm going to
pay my employees.

110
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,310
Who works, anybody work?

111
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,400
Okay.
What do you make?

112
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,708
>> $9 bucks an hour.

113
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,050
>> $9 bucks an hour.

114
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,920
And if you have a busy hour, they pay you
a little more?

115
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,530
>> No.

116
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,380
>> No.
So is that a variable or fixed?

117
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,730
>> It's fixed.

118
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,310
>> Fixed.
What happens if business is really bad?

119
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,935
What happens next month?
>> I don't have any

120
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:17,290
[INAUDIBLE].

121
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,420
I would like to think it would stay the
same because.

122
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,180
>> Oh, we would doubt that it would stay
the same.

123
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,485
What's likely to happen?

124
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,660
[CROSSTALK].

125
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,028
You'd probably get scheduled for fewer
hours.

126
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:34,420
So again, it's kind of fixed but it's kind
of variable, so again, some

127
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,540
things might fit in different categories
and

128
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,420
you might have different types of labor.

129
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,710
You might have salary where people make X
dollars per

130
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,630
year, or X hours per hour, and that's
pretty set.

131
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,215
You might have other people that are
commissioned based.

132
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:48,450
Particularly sales people are often
commission based.

133
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,390
What's commission?

134
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,870
>> I think

135
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,400
you get extra money on top of your, like,
salary for how much you sell.

136
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,566
>> You make some percentage of your
sale, so you might make 8, 10, $12

137
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:07,060
an hour, but you might make 3 or 5%
commission in addition to that.

138
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,150
So in that way, again, it's an added
incentive,

139
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,260
and so it's a combination of fixed and
variable costs.

140
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,050
So, again, think about these when you're
thinking

141
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,920
about your venture, and what types of cost

142
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,140
you incur, when, and for what purpose.

143
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,840
What that looks like, and this is just a,
kind of a,

144
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,150
abbreviated income statement, is that you
have your revenues on top, or sales.

145
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,250
For example in year one, we only, only

146
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,460
may have one product or one category of
product.

147
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,890
We have expenses associated with that,
there's some R&D cost, there's some

148
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,910
cost of goods sold, there's some

149
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,620
marketing, there's some salaries, and
there

150
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,310
might be other pieces that are missing
from this.

151
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,270
If you're doing a bricks and mortar, a
face to face retail operation,

152
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,090
you would have lease or rent in there, you
would have utilities in there.

153
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,900
So think about what cost makes sense

154
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,310
for the types of ventures that you're
considering.

155
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,510
And there's going to be a pretax profit.
Just simply revenues minus expenses.

156
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,630
There is taxes, taxes vary widely based

157
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,350
on the type of business you're in, the
country

158
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,180
and the region and the city that you're
operating within.

159
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,754
So again, the 20% here is just an example.

160
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:19,210
you want to be aware of what the taxes are
wherever you're operating.

161
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:26,260
After tax is simply profit, minus tax.
And then your net profit margin is that

162
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:32,770
profit after tax divided by your revenues.
When you look at

163
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:38,390
year two, our revenues went up.
Why is that a reasonable assumption?

164
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,040
Yep.
>> Your product is more known.

165
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,310
>> Okay, you begin to build a brand.

166
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,670
>> You could also release a second
product.

167
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,280
>> You released a second product, as
what we see here.

168
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,420
>> you're not paying to start things up
again.

169
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,215
>> You aren't paying as much R&D.

170
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,930
And again, and here we don't see a fixture

171
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,910
or facility or other element, but in
practice you may.

172
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,410
so again, you might not have incurred

173
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,650
some of those start-up costs again, but
here we do see R&D is lower.

174
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,610
What is higher?

175
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,530
>> Marketing.
>> Marketing.

176
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:24,000
It would make sense that if we take our
marketing budget from $15,000 to $70,000,

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,070
that our marketing should be better.
That it should generate more sales.

178
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,375
Oftentimes I see this misrepresented,
where people

179
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,465
think they're going to spend a lot in
marketing

180
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:38,610
to begin with, and then that's going to
decline

181
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,770
over time and their sales are going to
increase.

182
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,120
Marketing and sales tend to be somewhat
complimentary.

183
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,300
You tend have to put more in marketing to
get more sales.

184
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,670
And to keep sales high you need to put
more in marketing.

185
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,460
So in that way, again, you do benefit from

186
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,920
brand, maybe you benefit from repeat
customers, maybe there

187
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,070
are the partnerships you establish that
contribute to sales.

188
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,250
But be careful not to under-invest in

189
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,150
marketing or try and contract your
marketing.

190
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,670
What about salaries?
We're paying 5K the first year.

191
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,930
Not a very good salary.

192
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:22,100
>> well you could of given out a raise
or hire more employees.

193
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,080
>> But what are we getting for 5K a year
in year one?

194
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:33,570
So to give you a sense of what 5K is, if
it's 50 weeks, it's how much a week?

195
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,196
>> 500.
>> Nope.

196
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:35,196
>>

197
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:36,834
[INAUDIBLE].

198
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:41,310
>> {INAUDIBLE] Have to take a refresher
math course.

199
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,760
>> It's a hundred.
>> It's a hundred.

200
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,880
5000 divided by 50, a

201
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,070
hundred a week.

202
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,560
So, most entrepreneurs, you're at a 50, 60
hour

203
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,270
a week, so you're making about 2 bucks an
hour.

204
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:02,568
>>

205
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:04,312
[CROSSTALK].

206
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:05,014
>> Good wage?
>>

207
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:05,840
[CROSSTALK].

208
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,010
>> And there might be two or three or
four of

209
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,340
you working on it, so you're making about
$0.50 an hour.

210
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,340
>>

211
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,997
[CROSSTALK].

212
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,910
>> You save up all day, you can go to
Starbucks.

213
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,380
You'd probably have to share it with your
team.

214
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,220
Why do we do such things?

215
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,120
>> For the future, because.
>> because we have a future mindset.

216
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,250
So it's not uncommon that there may be few
if any dollars,

217
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,100
particularly for the founders and the
executives of the team, in the beginning.

218
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,150
And you worked largely for free for a
period of time.

219
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,691
And that's typically the norm.
How do you pay your rent?

220
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,361
How do you make your car payment?

221
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:52,880
How do you eat?
>> Second job.

222
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,380
>> You might work somewhere else.

223
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,210
Hard, in my experience, to start a company

224
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,770
successfully while you're working full
time somewhere else.

225
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,680
So there's an element again, of kind of
how do I manage my time?

226
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,580
Do I work full time somewhere and start my
venture at night and on the weekend?

227
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,730
Do I work part time at night on

228
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,410
the weekend and start my venture during
the day?

229
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,390
What else might you do?

230
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,820
>> Take loans.

231
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,495
>> You might take loans but, again, in
the beginning

232
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:24,580
it's going to be hard for your venture to
get funding.

233
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,140
And banks want what when they make loans?

234
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,650
>> Interest.
>> Interest in?

235
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,693
>> Future profitability.
>> What do they, when you

236
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:41,440
get a loan, what do banks typically like?
Starts with a C.

237
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,752
>> Cash.

238
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:45,830
>> Credit, cash money?
>> Ends with an L.

239
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:45,830
>>

240
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,100
[INAUDIBLE].

241
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,500
>> Second letter's O.
>> Collateral.

242
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,940
>> Collateral.

243
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,980
What is collateral?
>> Like your house or your car.

244
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,940
>> Collateral are assets.
I borrow money to buy a house.

245
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,055
I don't pay my mortgage, what happens to
my house?

246
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:02,055
>>

247
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:02,735
[INAUDIBLE].

248
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:03,460
>> Bank owns it.

249
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,330
I borrowed money for a car, I stopped
paying

250
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,980
my car payment, bank comes picks up my
car.

251
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,300
So again, you might be able to get loans
in the beginning but

252
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,750
they're probably going to be personal
loans,

253
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,070
meaning that you have to have collateral.

254
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,080
If you don't have collateral, might be
hard to get a loan.

255
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,960
People heard of savings?

256
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,130
Kind of rare these days.

257
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,310
A lot of entrepreneurs have saved some
money, and

258
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,940
or, just live cheaply to get their
ventures moving.

259
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,399
And that way they can put their full
attention to it.

260
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,640
And take advantage of the opportunities
that they see ahead of them.

261
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,980
So again, this is the starting point for
thinking about sales forecast and

262
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,700
this is kind of what you want to end up
with in the end.

263
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,555
When you're doing your investor
presentations, when

264
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:57,340
you're doing your business plans, you'd
like

265
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,920
to be able to craft something that kind of
looks like this in the end.

266
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,060
But there's a question of where do you
start?

267
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,780
What numbers do you start putting in
initially?

268
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,570
What's the first number you put in?
>>

269
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,820
[INAUDIBLE].

270
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,000
>> Expenses or revenue?

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,050
>> Expenses, but again I don't quite
know what my expenses are.

272
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:27,360
Maybe I know that I need a location and
maybe that's $3,000 a month.

273
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,880
Maybe I know that I need some equipment
and that's $10,000 a month.

274
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,380
But I don't necessarily know how much
labor I need.

275
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,350
I don't necessarily know much inventory I
need.

276
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,000
So there's

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,635
still some gaps.
So where else do you start?

278
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:46,350
because it is a bit of a puzzle.
What was your, somebody said another?

279
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,930
>> Was it the.
>> Where do you start?

280
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,390
You might start with the revenues.

281
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,480
We like to start in the upper left-hand
corner.

282
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:59,950
To cling to English system, that's where
we start reading, so we

283
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,110
look to that upper-left and we think that,
that's our starting point.

284
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,110
So what do you put down for your year one
revenues?

285
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,810
When you think about the ventures that
you're going to start?

286
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,010
What's your year one revenue goal?

287
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:18,910
>> At least break even.
>> At least break even but

288
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,220
you don't know yet what your expenses are.
So you can't

289
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,555
set it to break even without knowing your
expenses, so what's your revenue goal?

290
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:30,392
[SOUND].

291
00:15:30,392 --> 00:15:32,810
Yep.

292
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,930
>> Manufacturing costs and all the other
costs plus your.

293
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,530
>> But you don't know what your
manufacturing costs are

294
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,490
unless you know what your sales are
going to be, right?

295
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,990
So it's a bit of a chicken and egg.

296
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,180
Yep.

297
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,380
>> It'd be like the money you put

298
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,100
into actually start up, like, the company
or business.

299
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,690
>> You might not have a sense of how

300
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,530
much you need to put in without knowing
your expenses,

301
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,520
which you don't know unless you know your
revenues.

302
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,800
So where do you start?

303
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,890
because you guys are going to be doing
this later today.

304
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,070
What's your starting point?
>> Find out market research.

305
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,580
>> What does that do for you?

306
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:19,540
>> How many people you're going to sell
to.

307
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,900
>> How many people you're going to sell
to.

308
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,340
It's a bit tricky.

309
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,610
It's a bit tricky.

310
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,820
I would argue that you would start on

311
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,210
thinking about the profit and the profit
margin.

312
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,750
How do I know profit margin?
Seems like an odd place to start.

313
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,790
How do I know profit margin for my
business?

314
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,810
How

315
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,170
do you know what the temperature is
outside?

316
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,480
>> {INAUDIBLE].

317
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,680
>> Forecast.

318
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,073
>> You don't forecast it.
What's the temperature outside now?

319
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:55,073
>>

320
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:57,322
[INAUDIBLE].

321
00:16:57,322 --> 00:16:59,348
>> How do you know?
>> Look it up.

322
00:16:59,348 --> 00:17:02,575
>> You look it up.
You look it up.

323
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:06,209
There is significant research out there on
what are the

324
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,800
profit margins on average for various
industries and market sectors.

325
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,320
So again, you look it up, you figure

326
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,690
out what's the average profit margin for
my industry.

327
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:23,540
Now what do we know about averages?
>> Half

328
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,250
are above.
>> Half are above and half are below.

329
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,680
So for you, if you're in a, operating in a

330
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,556
premium market, you might be a little bit
above that.

331
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:36,780
If you're a start-up and don't have the
economies of scale of

332
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,450
a lot of companies, you might be a little
bit below that.

333
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,530
But it gives you at least a starting point
of

334
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,650
thinking about what's the average profit
margin in my industry.

335
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,580
If you know profit margin, you can begin
to

336
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:54,350
get a sense of what your income goals are
and what your profit

337
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:59,040
needs to be to reach those income goals
and then

338
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,110
you can back out your revenues from there.
And we'll look at how to do that.

339
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,380
Once you have a revenue target in mind,
then you can

340
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,760
figure out what expenses do I incur to
reach that revenue goal.

341
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,350
So again,

342
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,299
start with profit margins and profit
dollars.

343
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,220
From there you can get to revenues, and
from there you can get to expenses.

344
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,280
So how we do that is using this concept
called a

345
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,510
reverse income statement, where you start
with some element of profit.

346
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,798
And for many people their profit, their
year one, their

347
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,690
year two profit is going to be some
element of opportunity cost,

348
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,860
of what is it that you might be foregoing
to start this venture.

349
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,880
And most people would like to at least
have

350
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,480
enough in the end that they could cover
their salaries.

351
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,090
And so if you have a two person team, if
once everything is

352
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,250
said and done and once you've paid all of
your expenses, if you

353
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,980
wanted to be able to take home $50,000
each at the end of

354
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,038
year one, then you would have a year one
profit goal of $100,000.

355
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,440
If the average profit margin in your
industry is 20%,

356
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,480
you need $500,000 in revenue for the 20%
profit of that

357
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,440
to equal the $100,000 that is your goal.
Does

358
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,440
that make sense?

359
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,040
And so, in that way, to know I have this
$500,000,

360
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,090
there's a question of what do I do to get
to that?

361
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,940
How do I reach that?

362
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,300
And so then we go down the path

363
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,278
of incorporating other assumptions and
thinking about the expenses.

364
00:19:52,278 --> 00:20:00,220
Now that 20%, again, how did I get that?
And there are a variety of resources

365
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,800
out there, I have a link here for some
work that the business school in NYU

366
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,250
has put together.

367
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,170
And again this a sample, if you go to

368
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,730
this link you'll see dozens and dozens of
various industries.

369
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,570
Industries listed, but for apparel, for
example, based on the 54 firms

370
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:24,314
that they surveyed, on the far right-hand
side, you'll see 6.59%

371
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:28,820
as the average net profit margin for
apparel.

372
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,750
So that could be the number that you would
start

373
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,010
with as you are beginning to think about
your venture.

374
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,320
Now you can flex that, you can add a
little to it, you can subtract

375
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,360
some from it, thinking about where you

376
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,130
operate, but it gives you a starting
point.

377
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,090
And the income statements are a bit of a
puzzle as well,

378
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,020
you begin building it out and somethings
fit and other things don't.

379
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,870
And then you, again, revise and amend some
of

380
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,520
those and add some things, and take some
things out

381
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,610
to get to something that you believe is
realistic and comfortable.

382
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,920
But, the orientation here is that, again,

383
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,140
to pick a revenue goal is somewhat
arbitrary.

384
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,150
To say I want to make a $100,000, I want
to make

385
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,460
a million, I want to make a hundred
million, it's kind of random.

386
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,330
To go through and do expenses, you're just
kind of operating in the dark

387
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,330
without knowing what revenues are we
trying

388
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,560
to achieve, but again, profit people
understand.

389
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,920
Profit as far as, what are we going to
take home as the owners

390
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,990
or the founders of the company, I think is
a little more tangible.

391
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,640
And so, again, when you start with that
profit, you recognize your margin.

392
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,000
You back out what your revenue targets are
from there.

393
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,620
And then you can

394
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,590
figure out what expenses is it going to
take to reach that level of revenue.

395
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,370
So from there, there is the question of,
well once we know

396
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,180
the revenue and profit goals we need to
fill out the expenses.

397
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,680
If you are a new company in a new market
without a lot of other companies to

398
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,130
look at, you really have to think about
well,

399
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,420
what are each line item expense we're
going to incur.

400
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,175
Do we need a facility?
Do we need inventory?

401
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:08,650
Do we need equipment?
Do we need marketing?

402
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,090
Do we need this and that, and you build
that up incrementally.

403
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,830
If you are working in a space where there
are some existing players, particularly if

404
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,210
they are public companies, you can see
what they spend on a per item basis.

405
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,640
And that gives you some sense of what the
industry norms are as well.

406
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,650
And then you can see, for example in
apparel, if you look at the Gaps and the

407
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,130
others that are out there, and you see
that,

408
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,110
well they spend $400 million a year on
marketing,

409
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,920
is that what you're going to spend in year
one?

410
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:46,657
No, but if their marketing expense is 30%

411
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:52,570
of their sales, what can you do when you
know your revenue target?

412
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,120
What's the logical way to use that data?

413
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,850
Who's my apparel folks?
Okay, what do you do with that?

414
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,909
Just start in the middle.
What do you do with that number?

415
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,010
>> Sorry, could you repeat the question?

416
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,790
>> So Gap spends 30% of their sales on
marketing, how much did you spend?

417
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:25,450
>> Since we're new, I don't think we can

418
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,310
spend more than 30 or probably less, like
10%.

419
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,810
>> 10%.
>> 10.

420
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,393
>> I would argue more.
Why more?

421
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:33,968
>> I was going to say more because since
we're a

422
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:35,604
new company and we need to get our name
out.

423
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:38,192
>> You are new.
People don't know you.

424
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:40,835
People don't know you're Gap.
People don't know you're Old Navy.

425
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:44,456
People don't know you're Banana Republic.

426
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:50,790
Means you might need to spend 35, 40, 45%
of your revenues on marketing.

427
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,460
So in that way, it gives you some sense of
starting point and

428
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,970
what has it taken for industry leaders to
have success in their space.

429
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,600
In summary, when we look at sales
forecast, and we recognize that it is

430
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,080
a first step to being able to

431
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,449
develop reasonable financial statements
for the firm.

432
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,160
Also when you do these sales forecasts, I
would

433
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,320
certainly advise you to think about this
goal setting approach.

434
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,790
Think about

435
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,410
the reverse income statement.

436
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,400
Think about this as a helpful starting
point

437
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,506
for developing sales forecasts that are
real, sales forecasts

438
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,250
that are achievable, and sales forecasts
that will help

439
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,400
you reach the goals for you and your
organization.
